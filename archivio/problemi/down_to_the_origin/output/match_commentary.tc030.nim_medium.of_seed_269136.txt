The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[12, 19, 21, 13, 23, 17, 22, 25, 18, 29]
 - p=[230, 187, 233, 173, 201, 222, 245, 284, 206, 126]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[230, 187, 233, 173, 201, 222, 245, 284, 206, 126] (keep in mind that d=[12, 19, 21, 13, 23, 17, 22, 25, 18, 29], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   {next_ps}
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
