The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=1
 - d=[12]
 - p=[104]
our disinterested advice would be to go second.

The problem solver wants to go second. Ok, I'll take the first move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[104] (keep in mind that d=[12], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [104] to [92].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[92] (keep in mind that d=[12], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [92] to [91].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[91] (keep in mind that d=[12], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [91] to [79].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[79] (keep in mind that d=[12], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [79] to [78].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[78] (keep in mind that d=[12], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [78] to [66].

# p=[66] (keep in mind that d=[12], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [66] to [65].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[65] (keep in mind that d=[12], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [65] to [53].
