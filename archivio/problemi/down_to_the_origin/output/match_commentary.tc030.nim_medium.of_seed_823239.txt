The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[12, 14, 25, 18, 18, 13, 23, 14, 20, 28]
 - p=[185, 241, 287, 143, 192, 288, 251, 247, 205, 223]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[185, 241, 287, 143, 192, 288, 251, 247, 205, 223] (keep in mind that d=[12, 14, 25, 18, 18, 13, 23, 14, 20, 28], to grasp the whole situation).

Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
