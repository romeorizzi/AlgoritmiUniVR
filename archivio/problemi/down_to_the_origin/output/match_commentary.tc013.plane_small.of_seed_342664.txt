The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[3, 2]
 - p=[14, 14]
our disinterested advice would be to go second.

The problem solver wants to go second. Ok, I'll take the first move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[14, 14] (keep in mind that d=[3, 2], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [14, 14] to [11, 14].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[11, 14] (keep in mind that d=[3, 2], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [11, 14] to [10, 14].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[10, 14] (keep in mind that d=[3, 2], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [10, 14] to [7, 14].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[7, 14] (keep in mind that d=[3, 2], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [7, 14] to [6, 14].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[6, 14] (keep in mind that d=[3, 2], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [6, 14] to [3, 14].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[3, 14] (keep in mind that d=[3, 2], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [3, 14] to [2, 14].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[2, 14] (keep in mind that d=[3, 2], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [2, 14] to [0, 14].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 14] (keep in mind that d=[3, 2], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 14] to [0, 12].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 12] (keep in mind that d=[3, 2], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 12] to [0, 10].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 10] (keep in mind that d=[3, 2], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 10] to [0, 9].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 9] (keep in mind that d=[3, 2], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 9] to [0, 7].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 7] (keep in mind that d=[3, 2], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 7] to [0, 6].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 6] (keep in mind that d=[3, 2], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 6] to [0, 4].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 4] (keep in mind that d=[3, 2], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 4] to [0, 3].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 3] (keep in mind that d=[3, 2], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 3] to [0, 1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 1] (keep in mind that d=[3, 2], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 1] to [0, 0].
