The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[3, 6]
 - p=[6, 5]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[6, 5] (keep in mind that d=[3, 6], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [6, 5] to [6, 2].
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [6, 5] to [6, 2]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[6, 2] (keep in mind that d=[3, 6], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [6, 2] to [3, 2].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[3, 2] (keep in mind that d=[3, 6], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [3, 2] to [2, 2].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[2, 2] (keep in mind that d=[3, 6], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [2, 2] to [0, 2].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 2] (keep in mind that d=[3, 6], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 2] to [0, 0].
