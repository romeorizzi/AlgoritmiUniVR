The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[48281, 33629, 36695, 37465, 33079, 34742, 24929, 46149, 21884, 39555]
 - p=[163406, 132156, 136439, 134163, 140724, 105380, 140809, 101490, 97627, 103549]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[163406, 132156, 136439, 134163, 140724, 105380, 140809, 101490, 97627, 103549] (keep in mind that d=[48281, 33629, 36695, 37465, 33079, 34742, 24929, 46149, 21884, 39555], to grasp the whole situation).
The {winning move =} is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
{next_ps} (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [163406, 132156, 136439, 134163, 140724, 105380, 140809, 101490, 97627, 103549] to [147286, 132156, 136439, 134163, 140724, 105380, 140809, 101490, 97627, 103549].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
