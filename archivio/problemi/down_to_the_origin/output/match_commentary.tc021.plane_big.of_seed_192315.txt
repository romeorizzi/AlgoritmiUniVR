The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[22147, 11300]
 - p=[80875, 32700]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[80875, 32700] (keep in mind that d=[22147, 11300], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [80875, 32700] to [76542, 32700].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[76542, 32700] (keep in mind that d=[22147, 11300], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [76542, 32700] to [54395, 32700].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[54395, 32700] (keep in mind that d=[22147, 11300], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   {next_ps}
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[54394, 32700] (keep in mind that d=[22147, 11300], to grasp the whole situation).

# The server is now facing the position:

The server reluctancty moves from [32246, 32700] to [10099, 32700].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:

 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   {next_ps}
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[10099, 21400] (keep in mind that d=[22147, 11300], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [10099, 21400] to [0, 21400].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 21400] (keep in mind that d=[22147, 11300], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 21400] to [0, 11301].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 11301] (keep in mind that d=[22147, 11300], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 11301] to [0, 1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 1] (keep in mind that d=[22147, 11300], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 1] to [0, 0].
