The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=1
 - d=[7012]
 - p=[69185]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[69185] (keep in mind that d=[7012], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [69185] to [63117].
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [69185] to [63117]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
