The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[40963, 3654]
 - p=[46428, 59227]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[46428, 59227] (keep in mind that d=[40963, 3654], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [46428, 59227] to [41711, 59227].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[41711, 59227] (keep in mind that d=[40963, 3654], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [41711, 59227] to [748, 59227].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:

The winning move [748, 55573] is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
[[747, 59227]] (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
