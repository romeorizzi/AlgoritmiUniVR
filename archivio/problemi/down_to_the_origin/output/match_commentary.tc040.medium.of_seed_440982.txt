The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[33, 37, 25, 27, 30, 23, 27, 31, 24, 31]
 - p=[181, 263, 187, 200, 114, 220, 114, 100, 190, 125]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[181, 263, 187, 200, 114, 220, 114, 100, 190, 125] (keep in mind that d=[33, 37, 25, 27, 30, 23, 27, 31, 24, 31], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [181, 263, 187, 200, 114, 220, 114, 100, 190, 125] to [181, 243, 187, 200, 114, 220, 114, 100, 190, 125].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
