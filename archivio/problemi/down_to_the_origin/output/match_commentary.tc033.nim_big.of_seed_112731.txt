The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[34544, 24468, 29425, 42119, 44532, 35037, 27970, 29783, 45921, 49988]
 - p=[112175, 190497, 155923, 154118, 114775, 130549, 124678, 198534, 136827, 187875]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[112175, 190497, 155923, 154118, 114775, 130549, 124678, 198534, 136827, 187875] (keep in mind that d=[34544, 24468, 29425, 42119, 44532, 35037, 27970, 29783, 45921, 49988], to grasp the whole situation).
The {winning move =} is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
{next_ps} (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [112175, 190497, 155923, 154118, 114775, 130549, 124678, 198534, 136827, 187875] to [112175, 190497, 155923, 154118, 114775, 130549, 124678, 189210, 136827, 187875].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
