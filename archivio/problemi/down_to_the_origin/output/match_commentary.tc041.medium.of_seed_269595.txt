The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[33, 37, 21, 27, 26, 32, 30, 31, 22, 32]
 - p=[203, 299, 295, 261, 223, 225, 300, 165, 256, 240]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:

Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
