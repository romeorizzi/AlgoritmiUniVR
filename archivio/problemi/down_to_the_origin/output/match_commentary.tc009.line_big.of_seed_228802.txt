The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=1
 - d=[10089]
 - p=[36969]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[36969] (keep in mind that d=[10089], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [36969] to [30270].
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [36969] to [30270]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[30270] (keep in mind that d=[10089], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [30270] to [20181].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[20181] (keep in mind that d=[10089], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [20181] to [20180].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[20180] (keep in mind that d=[10089], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [20180] to [10091].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[10091] (keep in mind that d=[10089], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [10091] to [10090].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[10090] (keep in mind that d=[10089], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [10090] to [1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[1] (keep in mind that d=[10089], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [1] to [0].
