The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[5, 5, 2, 3, 2, 4, 6, 3, 2, 3]
 - p=[7, 8, 17, 6, 6, 8, 15, 12, 5, 19]
our disinterested advice would be to go second.

The problem solver wants to go second. Ok, I'll take the first move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[7, 8, 17, 6, 6, 8, 15, 12, 5, 19] (keep in mind that d=[5, 5, 2, 3, 2, 4, 6, 3, 2, 3], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [7, 8, 17, 6, 6, 8, 15, 12, 5, 19] to [2, 8, 17, 6, 6, 8, 15, 12, 5, 19].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[2, 8, 17, 6, 6, 8, 15, 12, 5, 19] (keep in mind that d=[5, 5, 2, 3, 2, 4, 6, 3, 2, 3], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   [[2, 8, 17, 6, 6, 8, 9, 12, 5, 19], [2, 8, 17, 6, 6, 8, 15, 12, 5, 16], [2, 7, 17, 6, 6, 8, 15, 12, 5, 19], [2, 8, 17, 6, 6, 8, 15, 12, 4, 19], [2, 8, 16, 6, 6, 8, 15, 12, 5, 19], [1, 8, 17, 6, 6, 8, 15, 12, 5, 19], [2, 8, 17, 6, 6, 5, 15, 12, 5, 19], [2, 8, 17, 6, 6, 8, 15, 11, 5, 19], [2, 8, 17, 5, 6, 8, 15, 12, 5, 19]]
Move 2: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [2, 8, 17, 6, 6, 8, 15, 12, 5, 19] to [2, 8, 17, 6, 6, 8, 9, 12, 5, 19]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
