The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[6, 4]
 - p=[11, 17]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[11, 17] (keep in mind that d=[6, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The winning move [11, 14] is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
[[9, 17]] (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [11, 17] to [9, 17].
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [11, 17] to [9, 17]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[9, 17] (keep in mind that d=[6, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [9, 17] to [3, 17].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[3, 17] (keep in mind that d=[6, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [3, 17] to [2, 17].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[2, 17] (keep in mind that d=[6, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [2, 17] to [0, 17].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 17] (keep in mind that d=[6, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 17] to [0, 15].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 15] (keep in mind that d=[6, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 15] to [0, 11].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 11] (keep in mind that d=[6, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 11] to [0, 10].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 10] (keep in mind that d=[6, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 10] to [0, 6].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 6] (keep in mind that d=[6, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 6] to [0, 5].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 5] (keep in mind that d=[6, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 5] to [0, 1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 1] (keep in mind that d=[6, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 1] to [0, 0].
