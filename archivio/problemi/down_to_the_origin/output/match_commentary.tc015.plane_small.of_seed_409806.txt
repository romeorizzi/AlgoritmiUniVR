The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[2, 4]
 - p=[13, 7]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[13, 7] (keep in mind that d=[2, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The {winning move =} is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
{next_ps} (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [13, 7] to [11, 7].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[11, 7] (keep in mind that d=[2, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [11, 7] to [9, 7].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[9, 7] (keep in mind that d=[2, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [9, 7] to [8, 7].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[8, 7] (keep in mind that d=[2, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [8, 7] to [6, 7].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[6, 7] (keep in mind that d=[2, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [6, 7] to [6, 5].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[6, 5] (keep in mind that d=[2, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [6, 5] to [4, 5].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[4, 5] (keep in mind that d=[2, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [4, 5] to [4, 1].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[4, 1] (keep in mind that d=[2, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [4, 1] to [2, 1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[2, 1] (keep in mind that d=[2, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [2, 1] to [1, 1].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[1, 1] (keep in mind that d=[2, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [1, 1] to [0, 1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 1] (keep in mind that d=[2, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 1] to [0, 0].
