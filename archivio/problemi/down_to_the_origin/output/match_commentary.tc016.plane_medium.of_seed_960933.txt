The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[18, 12]
 - p=[70, 63]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[70, 63] (keep in mind that d=[18, 12], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [70, 63] to [68, 63].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[68, 63] (keep in mind that d=[18, 12], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [68, 63] to [50, 63].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[50, 63] (keep in mind that d=[18, 12], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   {next_ps}
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[50, 51] (keep in mind that d=[18, 12], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [50, 51] to [32, 51].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[32, 51] (keep in mind that d=[18, 12], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [32, 51] to [31, 51].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[31, 51] (keep in mind that d=[18, 12], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [31, 51] to [13, 51].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[13, 51] (keep in mind that d=[18, 12], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [13, 51] to [12, 51].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[12, 51] (keep in mind that d=[18, 12], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [12, 51] to [0, 51].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 51] (keep in mind that d=[18, 12], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 51] to [0, 39].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 39] (keep in mind that d=[18, 12], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 39] to [0, 27].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 27] (keep in mind that d=[18, 12], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 27] to [0, 26].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 26] (keep in mind that d=[18, 12], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 26] to [0, 14].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 14] (keep in mind that d=[18, 12], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 14] to [0, 13].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 13] (keep in mind that d=[18, 12], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 13] to [0, 1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 1] (keep in mind that d=[18, 12], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 1] to [0, 0].
