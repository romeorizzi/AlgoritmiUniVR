The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[47321, 23840, 26763, 36587, 43465, 35152, 34807, 45752, 42875, 25558]
 - p=[93218, 112833, 164796, 115102, 161554, 163426, 166178, 133403, 167129, 187226]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[93218, 112833, 164796, 115102, 161554, 163426, 166178, 133403, 167129, 187226] (keep in mind that d=[47321, 23840, 26763, 36587, 43465, 35152, 34807, 45752, 42875, 25558], to grasp the whole situation).
The {winning move =} is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
{next_ps} (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [93218, 112833, 164796, 115102, 161554, 163426, 166178, 133403, 167129, 187226] to [93218, 112833, 164796, 115102, 161554, 163426, 166178, 94625, 167129, 187226].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
