The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=1
 - d=[7438]
 - p=[38866]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[38866] (keep in mind that d=[7438], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [38866] to [37195].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[37195] (keep in mind that d=[7438], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [37195] to [29757].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[29757] (keep in mind that d=[7438], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [29757] to [29756].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[29756] (keep in mind that d=[7438], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [29756] to [22318].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[22318] (keep in mind that d=[7438], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [22318] to [22317].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[22317] (keep in mind that d=[7438], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [22317] to [14879].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[14879] (keep in mind that d=[7438], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [14879] to [14878].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[14878] (keep in mind that d=[7438], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [14878] to [7440].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[7440] (keep in mind that d=[7438], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [7440] to [7439].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[7439] (keep in mind that d=[7438], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [7439] to [1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[1] (keep in mind that d=[7438], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [1] to [0].
