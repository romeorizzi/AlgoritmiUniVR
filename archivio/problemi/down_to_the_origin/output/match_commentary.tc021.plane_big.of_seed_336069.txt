The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[32846, 9220]
 - p=[27713, 43642]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[27713, 43642] (keep in mind that d=[32846, 9220], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [27713, 43642] to [6758, 43642].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[6758, 43642] (keep in mind that d=[32846, 9220], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [6758, 43642] to [0, 43642].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 43642] (keep in mind that d=[32846, 9220], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 43642] to [0, 36884].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 36884] (keep in mind that d=[32846, 9220], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 36884] to [0, 27664].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 27664] (keep in mind that d=[32846, 9220], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 27664] to [0, 27663].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 27663] (keep in mind that d=[32846, 9220], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 27663] to [0, 18443].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 18443] (keep in mind that d=[32846, 9220], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 18443] to [0, 18442].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 18442] (keep in mind that d=[32846, 9220], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 18442] to [0, 9222].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 9222] (keep in mind that d=[32846, 9220], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 9222] to [0, 9221].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 9221] (keep in mind that d=[32846, 9220], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 9221] to [0, 1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 1] (keep in mind that d=[32846, 9220], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 1] to [0, 0].
