The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[36313, 29619, 50466, 37740, 28705, 51075, 24633, 32378, 49566, 22809]
 - p=[130853, 146744, 134226, 139817, 149301, 164011, 117135, 198113, 146930, 112820]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[130853, 146744, 134226, 139817, 149301, 164011, 117135, 198113, 146930, 112820] (keep in mind that d=[36313, 29619, 50466, 37740, 28705, 51075, 24633, 32378, 49566, 22809], to grasp the whole situation).
The {winning move =} is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
{next_ps} (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [130853, 146744, 134226, 139817, 149301, 164011, 117135, 198113, 146930, 112820] to [130853, 146744, 134226, 124942, 149301, 164011, 117135, 198113, 146930, 112820].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
