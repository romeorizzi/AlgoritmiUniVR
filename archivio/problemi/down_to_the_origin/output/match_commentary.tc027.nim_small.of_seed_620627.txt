The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[2, 2, 2, 6, 4, 6, 4, 6, 6, 5]
 - p=[14, 16, 4, 11, 6, 12, 9, 10, 11, 20]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[14, 16, 4, 11, 6, 12, 9, 10, 11, 20] (keep in mind that d=[2, 2, 2, 6, 4, 6, 4, 6, 6, 5], to grasp the whole situation).
The {winning move =} is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
{next_ps} (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [14, 16, 4, 11, 6, 12, 9, 10, 11, 20] to [14, 16, 4, 11, 6, 12, 9, 7, 11, 20].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
