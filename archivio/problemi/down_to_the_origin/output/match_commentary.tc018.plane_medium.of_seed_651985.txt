The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[17, 14]
 - p=[62, 92]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[62, 92] (keep in mind that d=[17, 14], to grasp the whole situation).
The {winning move =} is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
{next_ps} (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [62, 92] to [62, 83].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[62, 83] (keep in mind that d=[17, 14], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [62, 83] to [45, 83].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[45, 83] (keep in mind that d=[17, 14], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [45, 83] to [45, 69].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[45, 69] (keep in mind that d=[17, 14], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [45, 69] to [28, 69].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[28, 69] (keep in mind that d=[17, 14], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [28, 69] to [28, 55].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[28, 55] (keep in mind that d=[17, 14], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [28, 55] to [11, 55].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[11, 55] (keep in mind that d=[17, 14], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [11, 55] to [10, 55].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[10, 55] (keep in mind that d=[17, 14], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [10, 55] to [0, 55].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 55] (keep in mind that d=[17, 14], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 55] to [0, 45].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 45] (keep in mind that d=[17, 14], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 45] to [0, 31].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 31] (keep in mind that d=[17, 14], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 31] to [0, 30].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 30] (keep in mind that d=[17, 14], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 30] to [0, 16].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 16] (keep in mind that d=[17, 14], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 16] to [0, 15].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 15] (keep in mind that d=[17, 14], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 15] to [0, 1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 1] (keep in mind that d=[17, 14], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 1] to [0, 0].
