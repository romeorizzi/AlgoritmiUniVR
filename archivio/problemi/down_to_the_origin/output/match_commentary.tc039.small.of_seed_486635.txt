The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[2, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6, 5, 6, 4, 2]
 - p=[14, 4, 8, 8, 13, 20, 8, 11, 10, 14]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[14, 4, 8, 8, 13, 20, 8, 11, 10, 14] (keep in mind that d=[2, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6, 5, 6, 4, 2], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   [[14, 4, 8, 8, 13, 20, 8, 8, 10, 14], [14, 4, 8, 8, 13, 17, 8, 11, 10, 14], [14, 4, 8, 8, 10, 20, 8, 11, 10, 14], [14, 1, 8, 8, 13, 20, 8, 11, 10, 14]]
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [14, 4, 8, 8, 13, 20, 8, 11, 10, 14] to [14, 4, 8, 8, 13, 20, 8, 8, 10, 14]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
