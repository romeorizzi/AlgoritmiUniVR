The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[32381, 29612, 25203, 50448, 41055, 38092, 42334, 27248, 44675, 43754]
 - p=[167114, 161850, 98116, 105106, 153893, 122314, 119382, 184012, 137555, 144325]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:

 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   {next_ps}
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
