The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[19, 19]
 - p=[74, 80]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[74, 80] (keep in mind that d=[19, 19], to grasp the whole situation).
The winning move [60, 80] is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
[[74, 74]] (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [74, 80] to [74, 74].
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [74, 80] to [74, 74]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[74, 74] (keep in mind that d=[19, 19], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [74, 74] to [55, 74].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[55, 74] (keep in mind that d=[19, 19], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [55, 74] to [54, 74].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[54, 74] (keep in mind that d=[19, 19], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [54, 74] to [35, 74].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[35, 74] (keep in mind that d=[19, 19], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [35, 74] to [34, 74].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[34, 74] (keep in mind that d=[19, 19], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [34, 74] to [15, 74].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[15, 74] (keep in mind that d=[19, 19], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [15, 74] to [14, 74].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[14, 74] (keep in mind that d=[19, 19], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [14, 74] to [0, 74].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 74] (keep in mind that d=[19, 19], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 74] to [0, 60].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 60] (keep in mind that d=[19, 19], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 60] to [0, 41].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 41] (keep in mind that d=[19, 19], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 41] to [0, 40].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 40] (keep in mind that d=[19, 19], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 40] to [0, 21].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 21] (keep in mind that d=[19, 19], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 21] to [0, 20].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 20] (keep in mind that d=[19, 19], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 20] to [0, 1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 1] (keep in mind that d=[19, 19], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 1] to [0, 0].
