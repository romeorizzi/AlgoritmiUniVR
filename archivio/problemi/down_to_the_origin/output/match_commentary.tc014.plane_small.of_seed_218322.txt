The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[2, 5]
 - p=[15, 12]
our disinterested advice would be to go second.

The problem solver wants to go second. Ok, I'll take the first move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[15, 12] (keep in mind that d=[2, 5], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [15, 12] to [13, 12].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[13, 12] (keep in mind that d=[2, 5], to grasp the whole situation).
The {winning move =} is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
{next_ps} (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [13, 12] to [12, 12].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[12, 12] (keep in mind that d=[2, 5], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [12, 12] to [10, 12].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[10, 12] (keep in mind that d=[2, 5], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [10, 12] to [9, 12].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[9, 12] (keep in mind that d=[2, 5], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [9, 12] to [7, 12].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[7, 12] (keep in mind that d=[2, 5], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [7, 12] to [7, 7].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[7, 7] (keep in mind that d=[2, 5], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [7, 7] to [5, 7].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[5, 7] (keep in mind that d=[2, 5], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [5, 7] to [5, 2].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[5, 2] (keep in mind that d=[2, 5], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [5, 2] to [3, 2].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[3, 2] (keep in mind that d=[2, 5], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [3, 2] to [3, 0].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[3, 0] (keep in mind that d=[2, 5], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [3, 0] to [1, 0].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[1, 0] (keep in mind that d=[2, 5], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [1, 0] to [0, 0].
