The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[11, 18]
 - p=[66, 84]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[66, 84] (keep in mind that d=[11, 18], to grasp the whole situation).
The {winning move =} is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
{next_ps} (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [66, 84] to [56, 84].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[56, 84] (keep in mind that d=[11, 18], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [56, 84] to [45, 84].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[45, 84] (keep in mind that d=[11, 18], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [45, 84] to [44, 84].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[44, 84] (keep in mind that d=[11, 18], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [44, 84] to [33, 84].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[33, 84] (keep in mind that d=[11, 18], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [33, 84] to [32, 84].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[32, 84] (keep in mind that d=[11, 18], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [32, 84] to [21, 84].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[21, 84] (keep in mind that d=[11, 18], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [21, 84] to [21, 66].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[21, 66] (keep in mind that d=[11, 18], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [21, 66] to [10, 66].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[10, 66] (keep in mind that d=[11, 18], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [10, 66] to [10, 48].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[10, 48] (keep in mind that d=[11, 18], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [10, 48] to [0, 48].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 48] (keep in mind that d=[11, 18], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 48] to [0, 38].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 38] (keep in mind that d=[11, 18], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 38] to [0, 20].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 20] (keep in mind that d=[11, 18], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 20] to [0, 19].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 19] (keep in mind that d=[11, 18], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 19] to [0, 1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 1] (keep in mind that d=[11, 18], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 1] to [0, 0].
