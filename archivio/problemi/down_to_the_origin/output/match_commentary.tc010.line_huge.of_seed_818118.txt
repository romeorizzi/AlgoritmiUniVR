The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=1
 - d=[8058143]
 - p=[76015610]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[76015610] (keep in mind that d=[8058143], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [76015610] to [72523296].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
