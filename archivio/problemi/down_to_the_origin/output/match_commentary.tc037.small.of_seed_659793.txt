The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[4, 2, 5, 6, 5, 6, 3, 5, 4, 6]
 - p=[17, 11, 5, 6, 14, 16, 20, 11, 17, 4]
our disinterested advice would be to go second.

The problem solver wants to go second. Ok, I'll take the first move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The server is now facing the position:

The server reluctancty moves from [17, 11, 5, 6, 14, 16, 20, 11, 17, 4] to [13, 11, 5, 6, 14, 16, 20, 11, 17, 4].

   {next_ps}
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
