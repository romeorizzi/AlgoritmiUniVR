The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[23793, 34737, 46092, 29472, 44964, 47898, 23094, 43475, 49365, 26860]
 - p=[173984, 195611, 94345, 198773, 194714, 165368, 184205, 158702, 113492, 106092]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:

 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   {next_ps}
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
