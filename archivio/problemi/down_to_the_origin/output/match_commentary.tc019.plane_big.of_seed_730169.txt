The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[32578, 22144]
 - p=[89593, 28161]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[89593, 28161] (keep in mind that d=[32578, 22144], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [89593, 28161] to [71174, 28161].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[71174, 28161] (keep in mind that d=[32578, 22144], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [71174, 28161] to [38596, 28161].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[38596, 28161] (keep in mind that d=[32578, 22144], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   {next_ps}
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[38595, 28161] (keep in mind that d=[32578, 22144], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [38595, 28161] to [6017, 28161].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[6017, 28161] (keep in mind that d=[32578, 22144], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   {next_ps}
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[6017, 6017] (keep in mind that d=[32578, 22144], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [6017, 6017] to [0, 6017].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 6017] (keep in mind that d=[32578, 22144], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 6017] to [0, 0].
