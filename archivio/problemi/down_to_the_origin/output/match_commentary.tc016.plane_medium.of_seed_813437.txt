The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[11, 11]
 - p=[74, 69]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[74, 69] (keep in mind that d=[11, 11], to grasp the whole situation).
The {winning move =} is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
{next_ps} (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [74, 69] to [69, 69].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[69, 69] (keep in mind that d=[11, 11], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [69, 69] to [58, 69].

The server reluctancty moves from [0, 12] to [0, 1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 1] (keep in mind that d=[11, 11], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 1] to [0, 0].
