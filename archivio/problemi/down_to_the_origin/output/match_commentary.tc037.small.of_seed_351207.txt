The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[6, 4, 4, 2, 6, 4, 4, 2, 2, 6]
 - p=[17, 10, 5, 9, 19, 14, 17, 14, 6, 20]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[17, 10, 5, 9, 19, 14, 17, 14, 6, 20] (keep in mind that d=[6, 4, 4, 2, 6, 4, 4, 2, 2, 6], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   [[17, 10, 4, 9, 19, 14, 17, 14, 6, 20], [17, 10, 5, 9, 19, 10, 17, 14, 6, 20], [17, 9, 5, 9, 19, 14, 17, 14, 6, 20], [17, 10, 5, 9, 15, 14, 17, 14, 6, 20], [17, 10, 5, 9, 19, 14, 17, 14, 6, 16]]
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [17, 10, 5, 9, 19, 14, 17, 14, 6, 20] to [17, 10, 4, 9, 19, 14, 17, 14, 6, 20]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
