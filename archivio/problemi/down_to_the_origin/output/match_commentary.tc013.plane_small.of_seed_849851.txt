The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[3, 5]
 - p=[14, 11]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[14, 11] (keep in mind that d=[3, 5], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [14, 11] to [14, 8].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[14, 8] (keep in mind that d=[3, 5], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [14, 8] to [11, 8].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[11, 8] (keep in mind that d=[3, 5], to grasp the whole situation).
The {winning move =} is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
{next_ps} (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [11, 8] to [10, 8].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[10, 8] (keep in mind that d=[3, 5], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [10, 8] to [7, 8].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[7, 8] (keep in mind that d=[3, 5], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [7, 8] to [7, 3].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[7, 3] (keep in mind that d=[3, 5], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [7, 3] to [4, 3].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[4, 3] (keep in mind that d=[3, 5], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [4, 3] to [4, 0].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[4, 0] (keep in mind that d=[3, 5], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [4, 0] to [1, 0].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[1, 0] (keep in mind that d=[3, 5], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [1, 0] to [0, 0].
