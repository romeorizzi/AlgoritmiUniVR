The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[4, 4]
 - p=[12, 7]
our disinterested advice would be to go second.

The problem solver wants to go second. Ok, I'll take the first move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[12, 7] (keep in mind that d=[4, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [12, 7] to [8, 7].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[8, 7] (keep in mind that d=[4, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The {winning move =} is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
{next_ps} (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [8, 7] to [8, 3].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[8, 3] (keep in mind that d=[4, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [8, 3] to [4, 3].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[4, 3] (keep in mind that d=[4, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [4, 3] to [3, 3].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[3, 3] (keep in mind that d=[4, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [3, 3] to [0, 3].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 3] (keep in mind that d=[4, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 3] to [0, 0].
