The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[11, 13]
 - p=[100, 52]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[100, 52] (keep in mind that d=[11, 13], to grasp the whole situation).
The {winning move =} is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
{next_ps} (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [100, 52] to [100, 46].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[100, 46] (keep in mind that d=[11, 13], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [100, 46] to [89, 46].

The problem solver moves from [7, 20] to [7, 7].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[7, 7] (keep in mind that d=[11, 13], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [7, 7] to [0, 7].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 7] (keep in mind that d=[11, 13], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 7] to [0, 0].
