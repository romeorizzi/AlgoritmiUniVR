The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[28, 12, 17, 20, 14, 13, 15, 24, 25, 13]
 - p=[118, 266, 283, 121, 103, 159, 282, 136, 202, 221]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
