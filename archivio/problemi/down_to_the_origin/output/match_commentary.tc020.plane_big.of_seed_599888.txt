The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[4743, 49100]
 - p=[61170, 61780]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[61170, 61780] (keep in mind that d=[4743, 49100], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [61170, 61780] to [61170, 53343].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[61170, 53343] (keep in mind that d=[4743, 49100], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [61170, 53343] to [56427, 53343].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[56427, 53343] (keep in mind that d=[4743, 49100], to grasp the whole situation).
The {winning move =} is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
{next_ps} (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
