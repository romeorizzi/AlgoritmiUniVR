The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[19, 13]
 - p=[55, 64]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[55, 64] (keep in mind that d=[19, 13], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [55, 64] to [48, 64].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[48, 64] (keep in mind that d=[19, 13], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [48, 64] to [29, 64].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[29, 64] (keep in mind that d=[19, 13], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   {next_ps}
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[29, 51] (keep in mind that d=[19, 13], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [29, 51] to [10, 51].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[10, 51] (keep in mind that d=[19, 13], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   {next_ps}
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[10, 38] (keep in mind that d=[19, 13], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [10, 38] to [0, 38].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 38] (keep in mind that d=[19, 13], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 38] to [0, 28].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 28] (keep in mind that d=[19, 13], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 28] to [0, 15].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 15] (keep in mind that d=[19, 13], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 15] to [0, 14].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 14] (keep in mind that d=[19, 13], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 14] to [0, 1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 1] (keep in mind that d=[19, 13], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 1] to [0, 0].
