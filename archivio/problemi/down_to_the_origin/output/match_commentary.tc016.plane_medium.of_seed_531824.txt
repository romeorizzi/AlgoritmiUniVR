The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[14, 12]
 - p=[56, 91]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[56, 91] (keep in mind that d=[14, 12], to grasp the whole situation).
The {winning move =} is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
{next_ps} (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [56, 91] to [56, 89].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[56, 89] (keep in mind that d=[14, 12], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [56, 89] to [42, 89].

The server reluctancty moves from [0, 13] to [0, 1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 1] (keep in mind that d=[14, 12], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 1] to [0, 0].
