The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[26218, 29695, 43401, 47748, 45708, 40001, 28109, 41199, 43110, 22298]
 - p=[127857, 173438, 110174, 150705, 191398, 189470, 108076, 134189, 189066, 140772]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[127857, 173438, 110174, 150705, 191398, 189470, 108076, 134189, 189066, 140772] (keep in mind that d=[26218, 29695, 43401, 47748, 45708, 40001, 28109, 41199, 43110, 22298], to grasp the whole situation).
The {winning move =} is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
{next_ps} (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [127857, 173438, 110174, 150705, 191398, 189470, 108076, 134189, 189066, 140772] to [127857, 173438, 110174, 150705, 191398, 189470, 108076, 93625, 189066, 140772].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
