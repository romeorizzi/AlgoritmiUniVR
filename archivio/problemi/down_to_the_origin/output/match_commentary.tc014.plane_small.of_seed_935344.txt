The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[6, 4]
 - p=[20, 19]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[20, 19] (keep in mind that d=[6, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [20, 19] to [18, 19].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[18, 19] (keep in mind that d=[6, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [18, 19] to [12, 19].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[12, 19] (keep in mind that d=[6, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [12, 19] to [11, 19].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[11, 19] (keep in mind that d=[6, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [11, 19] to [5, 19].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[5, 19] (keep in mind that d=[6, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [5, 19] to [4, 19].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[4, 19] (keep in mind that d=[6, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [4, 19] to [0, 19].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 19] (keep in mind that d=[6, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 19] to [0, 15].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 15] (keep in mind that d=[6, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 15] to [0, 11].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 11] (keep in mind that d=[6, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 11] to [0, 10].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 10] (keep in mind that d=[6, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 10] to [0, 6].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 6] (keep in mind that d=[6, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 6] to [0, 5].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 5] (keep in mind that d=[6, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 5] to [0, 1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 1] (keep in mind that d=[6, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 1] to [0, 0].
