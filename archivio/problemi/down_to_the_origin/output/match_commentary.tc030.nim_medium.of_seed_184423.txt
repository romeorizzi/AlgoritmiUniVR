The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[25, 29, 15, 24, 26, 22, 18, 28, 23, 15]
 - p=[111, 164, 200, 286, 199, 202, 287, 219, 199, 142]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[111, 164, 200, 286, 199, 202, 287, 219, 199, 142] (keep in mind that d=[25, 29, 15, 24, 26, 22, 18, 28, 23, 15], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   [[111, 164, 193, 286, 199, 202, 287, 219, 199, 142], [111, 164, 200, 286, 199, 202, 287, 219, 182, 142], [111, 164, 200, 286, 199, 202, 277, 219, 199, 142], [111, 164, 200, 286, 199, 202, 287, 199, 199, 142], [111, 164, 200, 286, 199, 202, 287, 219, 199, 135], [92, 164, 200, 286, 199, 202, 287, 219, 199, 142], [111, 157, 200, 286, 199, 202, 287, 219, 199, 142], [111, 164, 200, 286, 192, 202, 287, 219, 199, 142], [111, 164, 200, 277, 199, 202, 287, 219, 199, 142]]
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [111, 164, 200, 286, 199, 202, 287, 219, 199, 142] to [111, 164, 193, 286, 199, 202, 287, 219, 199, 142]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
