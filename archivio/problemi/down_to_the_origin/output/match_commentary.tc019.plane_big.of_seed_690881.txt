The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[27316, 18846]
 - p=[21698, 41743]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[21698, 41743] (keep in mind that d=[27316, 18846], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [21698, 41743] to [4049, 41743].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[4049, 41743] (keep in mind that d=[27316, 18846], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [4049, 41743] to [0, 41743].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 41743] (keep in mind that d=[27316, 18846], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 41743] to [0, 37694].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 37694] (keep in mind that d=[27316, 18846], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 37694] to [0, 18848].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 18848] (keep in mind that d=[27316, 18846], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 18848] to [0, 18847].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 18847] (keep in mind that d=[27316, 18846], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 18847] to [0, 1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 1] (keep in mind that d=[27316, 18846], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 1] to [0, 0].
