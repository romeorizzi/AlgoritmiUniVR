The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=1
 - d=[10393]
 - p=[40154]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[40154] (keep in mind that d=[10393], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [40154] to [31182].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[31182] (keep in mind that d=[10393], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [31182] to [20789].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[20789] (keep in mind that d=[10393], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [20789] to [20788].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[20788] (keep in mind that d=[10393], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [20788] to [10395].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[10395] (keep in mind that d=[10393], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [10395] to [10394].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[10394] (keep in mind that d=[10393], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [10394] to [1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[1] (keep in mind that d=[10393], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [1] to [0].
