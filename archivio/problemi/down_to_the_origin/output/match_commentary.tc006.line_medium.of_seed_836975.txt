The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=1
 - d=[17]
 - p=[104]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[104] (keep in mind that d=[17], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [104] to [90].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[90] (keep in mind that d=[17], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [90] to [73].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[73] (keep in mind that d=[17], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [73] to [72].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[72] (keep in mind that d=[17], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [72] to [55].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[55] (keep in mind that d=[17], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [55] to [54].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[54] (keep in mind that d=[17], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [54] to [37].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[37] (keep in mind that d=[17], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [37] to [36].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[36] (keep in mind that d=[17], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [36] to [19].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[19] (keep in mind that d=[17], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [19] to [18].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[18] (keep in mind that d=[17], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [18] to [1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[1] (keep in mind that d=[17], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [1] to [0].
