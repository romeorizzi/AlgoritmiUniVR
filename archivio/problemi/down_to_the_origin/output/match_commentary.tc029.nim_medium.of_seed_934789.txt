The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[13, 19, 21, 14, 28, 12, 12, 18, 28, 19]
 - p=[167, 132, 223, 204, 233, 181, 139, 169, 118, 266]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[167, 132, 223, 204, 233, 181, 139, 169, 118, 266] (keep in mind that d=[13, 19, 21, 14, 28, 12, 12, 18, 28, 19], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:

Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [167, 132, 223, 204, 233, 181, 139, 169, 118, 266] to [167, 132, 223, 204, 230, 181, 139, 169, 118, 266]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
