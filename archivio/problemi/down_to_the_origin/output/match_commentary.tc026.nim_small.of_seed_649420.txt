The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[6, 2, 5, 6, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6, 5]
 - p=[7, 20, 12, 20, 6, 14, 7, 18, 11, 19]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[7, 20, 12, 20, 6, 14, 7, 18, 11, 19] (keep in mind that d=[6, 2, 5, 6, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6, 5], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   [[6, 20, 12, 20, 6, 14, 7, 18, 11, 19], [7, 20, 12, 20, 6, 14, 6, 18, 11, 19], [7, 20, 12, 20, 6, 14, 7, 18, 9, 19], [7, 20, 12, 14, 6, 14, 7, 18, 11, 19], [7, 20, 12, 20, 6, 14, 7, 16, 11, 19], [7, 20, 12, 20, 6, 10, 7, 18, 11, 19]]
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [7, 20, 12, 20, 6, 14, 7, 18, 11, 19] to [6, 20, 12, 20, 6, 14, 7, 18, 11, 19]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
