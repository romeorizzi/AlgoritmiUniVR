The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[25483, 40001]
 - p=[66992, 62599]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[66992, 62599] (keep in mind that d=[25483, 40001], to grasp the whole situation).
The winning move [48081, 62599] is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
[[66992, 56026]] (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [66992, 62599] to [66992, 56026].
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [66992, 62599] to [66992, 56026]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
