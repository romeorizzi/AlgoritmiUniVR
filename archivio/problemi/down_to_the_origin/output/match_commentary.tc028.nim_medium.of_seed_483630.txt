The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[27, 22, 14, 26, 18, 26, 27, 12, 28, 15]
 - p=[252, 240, 206, 194, 154, 270, 106, 297, 284, 183]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[252, 240, 206, 194, 154, 270, 106, 297, 284, 183] (keep in mind that d=[27, 22, 14, 26, 18, 26, 27, 12, 28, 15], to grasp the whole situation).

Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
