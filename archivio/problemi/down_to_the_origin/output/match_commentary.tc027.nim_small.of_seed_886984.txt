The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[3, 4, 2, 2, 5, 4, 3, 3, 2, 3]
 - p=[19, 9, 5, 6, 16, 10, 16, 9, 20, 18]
our disinterested advice would be to go second.

The problem solver wants to go second. Ok, I'll take the first move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[19, 9, 5, 6, 16, 10, 16, 9, 20, 18] (keep in mind that d=[3, 4, 2, 2, 5, 4, 3, 3, 2, 3], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [19, 9, 5, 6, 16, 10, 16, 9, 20, 18] to [16, 9, 5, 6, 16, 10, 16, 9, 20, 18].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[16, 9, 5, 6, 16, 10, 16, 9, 20, 18] (keep in mind that d=[3, 4, 2, 2, 5, 4, 3, 3, 2, 3], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   [[15, 9, 5, 6, 16, 10, 16, 9, 20, 18], [16, 9, 5, 6, 16, 10, 15, 9, 20, 18], [16, 9, 5, 6, 16, 10, 16, 9, 20, 17], [16, 9, 5, 6, 16, 10, 16, 6, 20, 18], [16, 9, 5, 6, 16, 10, 16, 9, 19, 18], [16, 9, 4, 6, 16, 10, 16, 9, 20, 18], [16, 9, 5, 6, 16, 8, 16, 9, 20, 18]]
Move 2: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [16, 9, 5, 6, 16, 10, 16, 9, 20, 18] to [15, 9, 5, 6, 16, 10, 16, 9, 20, 18]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
