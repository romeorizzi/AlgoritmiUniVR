The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[31, 29, 28, 27, 28, 36, 37, 36, 30, 25]
 - p=[269, 157, 269, 266, 261, 237, 270, 234, 208, 220]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[269, 157, 269, 266, 261, 237, 270, 234, 208, 220] (keep in mind that d=[31, 29, 28, 27, 28, 36, 37, 36, 30, 25], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:

Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
