The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[3, 6]
 - p=[16, 5]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[16, 5] (keep in mind that d=[3, 6], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [16, 5] to [16, 0].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[16, 0] (keep in mind that d=[3, 6], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [16, 0] to [13, 0].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[13, 0] (keep in mind that d=[3, 6], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [13, 0] to [12, 0].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[12, 0] (keep in mind that d=[3, 6], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [12, 0] to [9, 0].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[9, 0] (keep in mind that d=[3, 6], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [9, 0] to [8, 0].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[8, 0] (keep in mind that d=[3, 6], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [8, 0] to [5, 0].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[5, 0] (keep in mind that d=[3, 6], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [5, 0] to [4, 0].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[4, 0] (keep in mind that d=[3, 6], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [4, 0] to [1, 0].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[1, 0] (keep in mind that d=[3, 6], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [1, 0] to [0, 0].
