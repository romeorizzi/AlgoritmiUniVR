The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[45074, 22979]
 - p=[73096, 41532]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[73096, 41532] (keep in mind that d=[45074, 22979], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [73096, 41532] to [63627, 41532].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[63627, 41532] (keep in mind that d=[45074, 22979], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [63627, 41532] to [18553, 41532].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[18553, 41532] (keep in mind that d=[45074, 22979], to grasp the whole situation).
The {winning move =} is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
{next_ps} (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [18553, 41532] to [18552, 41532].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[18552, 41532] (keep in mind that d=[45074, 22979], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [18552, 41532] to [0, 41532].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 41532] (keep in mind that d=[45074, 22979], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 41532] to [0, 22980].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 22980] (keep in mind that d=[45074, 22979], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 22980] to [0, 1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 1] (keep in mind that d=[45074, 22979], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 1] to [0, 0].
