The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[15, 15]
 - p=[51, 84]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[51, 84] (keep in mind that d=[15, 15], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   {next_ps}
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[36, 84] (keep in mind that d=[15, 15], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [36, 84] to [21, 84].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[21, 84] (keep in mind that d=[15, 15], to grasp the whole situation).

The server reluctancty moves from [21, 69] to [6, 69].

The server reluctancty moves from [5, 69] to [0, 69].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:

The problem solver moves from [0, 33] to [0, 32].
# The server is now facing the position:

The problem solver moves from [0, 17] to [0, 16].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 16] (keep in mind that d=[15, 15], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 16] to [0, 1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:

The problem solver moves from [0, 1] to [0, 0].
