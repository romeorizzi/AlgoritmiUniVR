The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[4, 4]
 - p=[6, 15]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[6, 15] (keep in mind that d=[4, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   [[5, 15], [6, 11]]
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [6, 15] to [5, 15]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[5, 15] (keep in mind that d=[4, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [5, 15] to [1, 15].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[1, 15] (keep in mind that d=[4, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   [[1, 11], [0, 15]]
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[1, 11] (keep in mind that d=[4, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [1, 11] to [0, 11].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 11] (keep in mind that d=[4, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 11] to [0, 10].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 10] (keep in mind that d=[4, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 10] to [0, 6].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 6] (keep in mind that d=[4, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 6] to [0, 5].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 5] (keep in mind that d=[4, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 5] to [0, 1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 1] (keep in mind that d=[4, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 1] to [0, 0].
