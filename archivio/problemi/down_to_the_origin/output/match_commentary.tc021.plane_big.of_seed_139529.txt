The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[32591, 19662]
 - p=[63526, 81677]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[63526, 81677] (keep in mind that d=[32591, 19662], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [63526, 81677] to [35617, 81677].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[35617, 81677] (keep in mind that d=[32591, 19662], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [35617, 81677] to [3026, 81677].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[3026, 81677] (keep in mind that d=[32591, 19662], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   {next_ps}
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[3026, 62015] (keep in mind that d=[32591, 19662], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [3026, 62015] to [0, 62015].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 62015] (keep in mind that d=[32591, 19662], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 62015] to [0, 58989].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 58989] (keep in mind that d=[32591, 19662], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 58989] to [0, 39327].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 39327] (keep in mind that d=[32591, 19662], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 39327] to [0, 39326].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 39326] (keep in mind that d=[32591, 19662], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 39326] to [0, 19664].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 19664] (keep in mind that d=[32591, 19662], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 19664] to [0, 19663].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 19663] (keep in mind that d=[32591, 19662], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 19663] to [0, 1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 1] (keep in mind that d=[32591, 19662], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 1] to [0, 0].
