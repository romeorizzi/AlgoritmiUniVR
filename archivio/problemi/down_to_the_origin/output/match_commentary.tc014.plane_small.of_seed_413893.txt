The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[2, 6]
 - p=[4, 9]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[4, 9] (keep in mind that d=[2, 6], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   {next_ps}
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[4, 8] (keep in mind that d=[2, 6], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [4, 8] to [2, 8].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[2, 8] (keep in mind that d=[2, 6], to grasp the whole situation).

The server reluctancty moves from [2, 2] to [0, 2].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 2] (keep in mind that d=[2, 6], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 2] to [0, 0].
