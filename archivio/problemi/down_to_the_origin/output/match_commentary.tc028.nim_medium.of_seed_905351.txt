The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[21, 19, 21, 16, 25, 16, 28, 22, 19, 14]
 - p=[170, 127, 139, 265, 241, 248, 292, 238, 212, 272]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:

Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
