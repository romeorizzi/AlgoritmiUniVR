The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=1
 - d=[27]
 - p=[126]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[126] (keep in mind that d=[27], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [126] to [112].
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [126] to [112]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[112] (keep in mind that d=[27], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [112] to [85].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[85] (keep in mind that d=[27], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [85] to [84].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[84] (keep in mind that d=[27], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [84] to [57].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[57] (keep in mind that d=[27], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [57] to [56].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[56] (keep in mind that d=[27], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [56] to [29].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[29] (keep in mind that d=[27], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [29] to [28].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[28] (keep in mind that d=[27], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [28] to [1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[1] (keep in mind that d=[27], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [1] to [0].
