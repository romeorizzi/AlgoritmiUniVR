The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[20, 23, 25, 16, 24, 23, 21, 16, 28, 18]
 - p=[201, 187, 154, 180, 131, 126, 121, 170, 125, 136]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[201, 187, 154, 180, 131, 126, 121, 170, 125, 136] (keep in mind that d=[20, 23, 25, 16, 24, 23, 21, 16, 28, 18], to grasp the whole situation).
The winning move [189, 187, 154, 180, 131, 126, 121, 170, 125, 136] is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
[[201, 187, 154, 180, 131, 126, 121, 165, 125, 136]] (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [201, 187, 154, 180, 131, 126, 121, 170, 125, 136] to [201, 187, 154, 180, 131, 126, 121, 165, 125, 136].
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [201, 187, 154, 180, 131, 126, 121, 170, 125, 136] to [201, 187, 154, 180, 131, 126, 121, 165, 125, 136]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
