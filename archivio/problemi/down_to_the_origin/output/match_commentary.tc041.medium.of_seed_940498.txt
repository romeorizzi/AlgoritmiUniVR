The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[22, 29, 26, 36, 29, 29, 36, 21, 25, 26]
 - p=[102, 294, 210, 128, 123, 205, 284, 170, 181, 145]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
