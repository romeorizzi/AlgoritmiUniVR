The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=1
 - d=[28]
 - p=[293]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[293] (keep in mind that d=[28], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [293] to [290].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[290] (keep in mind that d=[28], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [290] to [262].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[262] (keep in mind that d=[28], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [262] to [261].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[261] (keep in mind that d=[28], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [261] to [233].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[233] (keep in mind that d=[28], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [233] to [232].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[232] (keep in mind that d=[28], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [232] to [204].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
