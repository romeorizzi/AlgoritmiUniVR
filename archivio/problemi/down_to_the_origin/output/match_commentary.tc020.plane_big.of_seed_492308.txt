The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[40664, 21187]
 - p=[65765, 40240]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[65765, 40240] (keep in mind that d=[40664, 21187], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [65765, 40240] to [59717, 40240].
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [65765, 40240] to [59717, 40240]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[59717, 40240] (keep in mind that d=[40664, 21187], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [59717, 40240] to [19053, 40240].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[19053, 40240] (keep in mind that d=[40664, 21187], to grasp the whole situation).
The winning move [19052, 40240] is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
[[19053, 19053]] (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [19053, 40240] to [19053, 19053].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[19053, 19053] (keep in mind that d=[40664, 21187], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [19053, 19053] to [0, 19053].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 19053] (keep in mind that d=[40664, 21187], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 19053] to [0, 0].
