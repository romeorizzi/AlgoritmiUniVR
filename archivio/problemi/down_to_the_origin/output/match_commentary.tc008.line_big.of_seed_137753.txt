The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=1
 - d=[8660]
 - p=[47390]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[47390] (keep in mind that d=[8660], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [47390] to [43305].
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [47390] to [43305]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# p=[43305] (keep in mind that d=[8660], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [43305] to [34645].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:

The problem solver moves from [34645] to [34644].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[34644] (keep in mind that d=[8660], to grasp the whole situation).

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[8661] (keep in mind that d=[8660], to grasp the whole situation).
