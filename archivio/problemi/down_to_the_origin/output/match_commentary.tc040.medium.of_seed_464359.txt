The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[30, 30, 33, 23, 29, 31, 35, 23, 35, 34]
 - p=[112, 257, 161, 212, 143, 226, 118, 244, 259, 159]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[112, 257, 161, 212, 143, 226, 118, 244, 259, 159] (keep in mind that d=[30, 30, 33, 23, 29, 31, 35, 23, 35, 34], to grasp the whole situation).
The {winning move =} is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
{next_ps} (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [112, 257, 161, 212, 143, 226, 118, 244, 259, 159] to [112, 257, 161, 212, 143, 226, 90, 244, 259, 159].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
