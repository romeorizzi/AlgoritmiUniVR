The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[6, 6, 2, 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, 6, 6]
 - p=[13, 6, 14, 14, 12, 18, 19, 16, 5, 4]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[13, 6, 14, 14, 12, 18, 19, 16, 5, 4] (keep in mind that d=[6, 6, 2, 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, 6, 6], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   [[13, 6, 14, 14, 12, 18, 19, 16, 2, 4], [13, 6, 14, 14, 12, 17, 19, 16, 5, 4], [13, 1, 14, 14, 12, 18, 19, 16, 5, 4], [13, 6, 14, 14, 12, 18, 19, 16, 5, 3], [13, 6, 14, 14, 9, 18, 19, 16, 5, 4], [8, 6, 14, 14, 12, 18, 19, 16, 5, 4], [13, 6, 14, 14, 12, 18, 16, 16, 5, 4]]
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [13, 6, 14, 14, 12, 18, 19, 16, 5, 4] to [13, 6, 14, 14, 12, 18, 19, 16, 2, 4]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
