The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[6, 2]
 - p=[13, 20]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[13, 20] (keep in mind that d=[6, 2], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [13, 20] to [9, 20].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[9, 20] (keep in mind that d=[6, 2], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [9, 20] to [3, 20].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[3, 20] (keep in mind that d=[6, 2], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [3, 20] to [2, 20].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[2, 20] (keep in mind that d=[6, 2], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [2, 20] to [0, 20].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 20] (keep in mind that d=[6, 2], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 20] to [0, 18].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 18] (keep in mind that d=[6, 2], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 18] to [0, 16].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 16] (keep in mind that d=[6, 2], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 16] to [0, 15].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 15] (keep in mind that d=[6, 2], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 15] to [0, 13].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 13] (keep in mind that d=[6, 2], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 13] to [0, 12].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 12] (keep in mind that d=[6, 2], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 12] to [0, 10].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 10] (keep in mind that d=[6, 2], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 10] to [0, 9].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 9] (keep in mind that d=[6, 2], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 9] to [0, 7].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 7] (keep in mind that d=[6, 2], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 7] to [0, 6].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 6] (keep in mind that d=[6, 2], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 6] to [0, 4].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 4] (keep in mind that d=[6, 2], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 4] to [0, 3].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 3] (keep in mind that d=[6, 2], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 3] to [0, 1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 1] (keep in mind that d=[6, 2], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 1] to [0, 0].
