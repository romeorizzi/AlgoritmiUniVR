The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[13, 11]
 - p=[54, 68]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[54, 68] (keep in mind that d=[13, 11], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [54, 68] to [50, 68].
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [54, 68] to [50, 68]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[50, 68] (keep in mind that d=[13, 11], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [50, 68] to [37, 68].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[37, 68] (keep in mind that d=[13, 11], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   [[37, 57], [36, 68]]
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[37, 57] (keep in mind that d=[13, 11], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [37, 57] to [24, 57].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[24, 57] (keep in mind that d=[13, 11], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   [[24, 46], [23, 57]]
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[24, 46] (keep in mind that d=[13, 11], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [24, 46] to [11, 46].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[11, 46] (keep in mind that d=[13, 11], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   [[11, 35], [10, 46]]
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[11, 35] (keep in mind that d=[13, 11], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [11, 35] to [0, 35].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 35] (keep in mind that d=[13, 11], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 35] to [0, 24].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 24] (keep in mind that d=[13, 11], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 24] to [0, 13].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 13] (keep in mind that d=[13, 11], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 13] to [0, 12].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 12] (keep in mind that d=[13, 11], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 12] to [0, 1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 1] (keep in mind that d=[13, 11], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 1] to [0, 0].
