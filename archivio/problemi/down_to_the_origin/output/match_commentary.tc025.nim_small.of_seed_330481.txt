The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[6, 6, 3, 3, 5, 2, 5, 4, 4, 2]
 - p=[6, 19, 6, 18, 16, 18, 14, 9, 6, 15]
our disinterested advice would be to go second.

The problem solver wants to go second. Ok, I'll take the first move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[6, 19, 6, 18, 16, 18, 14, 9, 6, 15] (keep in mind that d=[6, 6, 3, 3, 5, 2, 5, 4, 4, 2], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [6, 19, 6, 18, 16, 18, 14, 9, 6, 15] to [0, 19, 6, 18, 16, 18, 14, 9, 6, 15].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 19, 6, 18, 16, 18, 14, 9, 6, 15] (keep in mind that d=[6, 6, 3, 3, 5, 2, 5, 4, 4, 2], to grasp the whole situation).
The winning move [0, 17, 6, 18, 16, 18, 14, 9, 6, 15] is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
[[0, 19, 6, 18, 16, 18, 14, 7, 6, 15]] (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [0, 19, 6, 18, 16, 18, 14, 9, 6, 15] to [0, 19, 6, 18, 16, 18, 14, 7, 6, 15].
Move 2: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [0, 19, 6, 18, 16, 18, 14, 9, 6, 15] to [0, 19, 6, 18, 16, 18, 14, 7, 6, 15]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
