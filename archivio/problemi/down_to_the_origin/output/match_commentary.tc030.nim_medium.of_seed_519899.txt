The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[29, 24, 17, 29, 18, 24, 17, 19, 29, 27]
 - p=[223, 213, 140, 230, 158, 254, 220, 284, 181, 250]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[223, 213, 140, 230, 158, 254, 220, 284, 181, 250] (keep in mind that d=[29, 24, 17, 29, 18, 24, 17, 19, 29, 27], to grasp the whole situation).
The winning move [194, 213, 140, 230, 158, 254, 220, 284, 181, 250] is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
[[223, 213, 140, 230, 158, 254, 220, 267, 181, 250]] (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [223, 213, 140, 230, 158, 254, 220, 284, 181, 250] to [223, 213, 140, 230, 158, 254, 220, 267, 181, 250].
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [223, 213, 140, 230, 158, 254, 220, 284, 181, 250] to [223, 213, 140, 230, 158, 254, 220, 267, 181, 250]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
