The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[18, 18]
 - p=[76, 65]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[76, 65] (keep in mind that d=[18, 18], to grasp the whole situation).
The {winning move =} is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
{next_ps} (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [76, 65] to [76, 57].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[76, 57] (keep in mind that d=[18, 18], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [76, 57] to [58, 57].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[58, 57] (keep in mind that d=[18, 18], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [58, 57] to [58, 39].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[58, 39] (keep in mind that d=[18, 18], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [58, 39] to [40, 39].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[40, 39] (keep in mind that d=[18, 18], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [40, 39] to [39, 39].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[39, 39] (keep in mind that d=[18, 18], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [39, 39] to [21, 39].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[21, 39] (keep in mind that d=[18, 18], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [21, 39] to [21, 21].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[21, 21] (keep in mind that d=[18, 18], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [21, 21] to [3, 21].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[3, 21] (keep in mind that d=[18, 18], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [3, 21] to [2, 21].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[2, 21] (keep in mind that d=[18, 18], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [2, 21] to [0, 21].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 21] (keep in mind that d=[18, 18], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 21] to [0, 19].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 19] (keep in mind that d=[18, 18], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 19] to [0, 1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 1] (keep in mind that d=[18, 18], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 1] to [0, 0].
