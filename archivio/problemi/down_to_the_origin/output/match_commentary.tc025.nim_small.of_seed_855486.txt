The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[4, 3, 6, 2, 2, 6, 6, 2, 5, 4]
 - p=[5, 12, 7, 12, 12, 20, 18, 5, 4, 9]
our disinterested advice would be to go second.

The problem solver wants to go second. Ok, I'll take the first move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The server is now facing the position:

The server reluctancty moves from [5, 12, 7, 12, 12, 20, 18, 5, 4, 9] to [1, 12, 7, 12, 12, 20, 18, 5, 4, 9].

 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   {next_ps}
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
