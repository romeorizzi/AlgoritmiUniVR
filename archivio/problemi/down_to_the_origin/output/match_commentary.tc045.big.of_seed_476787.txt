The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[38915, 34111, 35473, 43812, 50661, 50715, 45042, 34244, 33278, 51163]
 - p=[153355, 164183, 113974, 121325, 182136, 158125, 153661, 93976, 198587, 159506]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:

 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   {next_ps}
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
