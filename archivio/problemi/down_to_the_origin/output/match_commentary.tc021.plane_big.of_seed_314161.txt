The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[32226, 45489]
 - p=[59032, 48851]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[59032, 48851] (keep in mind that d=[32226, 45489], to grasp the whole situation).
The {winning move =} is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
{next_ps} (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [59032, 48851] to [59032, 26805].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[59032, 26805] (keep in mind that d=[32226, 45489], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [59032, 26805] to [26806, 26805].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[26806, 26805] (keep in mind that d=[32226, 45489], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [26806, 26805] to [26805, 26805].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[26805, 26805] (keep in mind that d=[32226, 45489], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [26805, 26805] to [0, 26805].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 26805] (keep in mind that d=[32226, 45489], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 26805] to [0, 0].
