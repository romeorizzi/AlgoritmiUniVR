The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[22, 32, 25, 24, 27, 31, 27, 33, 22, 22]
 - p=[297, 228, 149, 224, 242, 182, 258, 115, 206, 270]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[297, 228, 149, 224, 242, 182, 258, 115, 206, 270] (keep in mind that d=[22, 32, 25, 24, 27, 31, 27, 33, 22, 22], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   [[297, 228, 149, 224, 242, 182, 238, 115, 206, 270], [297, 228, 149, 224, 222, 182, 258, 115, 206, 270], [297, 228, 149, 224, 242, 182, 258, 107, 206, 270], [297, 220, 149, 224, 242, 182, 258, 115, 206, 270], [297, 228, 149, 216, 242, 182, 258, 115, 206, 270], [297, 228, 149, 224, 242, 158, 258, 115, 206, 270]]
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [297, 228, 149, 224, 242, 182, 258, 115, 206, 270] to [297, 228, 149, 224, 242, 182, 238, 115, 206, 270]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
