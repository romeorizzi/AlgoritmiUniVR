The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[18, 19]
 - p=[77, 61]
our disinterested advice would be to go second.

The problem solver wants to go second. Ok, I'll take the first move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[77, 61] (keep in mind that d=[18, 19], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [77, 61] to [59, 61].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[59, 61] (keep in mind that d=[18, 19], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   {next_ps}
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[58, 61] (keep in mind that d=[18, 19], to grasp the whole situation).
