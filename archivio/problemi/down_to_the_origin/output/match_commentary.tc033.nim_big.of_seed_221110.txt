The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[33240, 25467, 48302, 41728, 25282, 49703, 34557, 45444, 26617, 39332]
 - p=[196203, 132311, 102206, 146995, 172103, 179762, 116203, 122667, 135630, 184718]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[196203, 132311, 102206, 146995, 172103, 179762, 116203, 122667, 135630, 184718] (keep in mind that d=[33240, 25467, 48302, 41728, 25282, 49703, 34557, 45444, 26617, 39332], to grasp the whole situation).
The {winning move =} is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
{next_ps} (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [196203, 132311, 102206, 146995, 172103, 179762, 116203, 122667, 135630, 184718] to [196203, 132311, 57707, 146995, 172103, 179762, 116203, 122667, 135630, 184718].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
