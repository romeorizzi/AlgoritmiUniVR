The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[28, 32, 25, 28, 26, 26, 26, 25, 30, 28]
 - p=[165, 132, 278, 116, 127, 154, 105, 153, 275, 217]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[165, 132, 278, 116, 127, 154, 105, 153, 275, 217] (keep in mind that d=[28, 32, 25, 28, 26, 26, 26, 25, 30, 28], to grasp the whole situation).
The winning move [153, 132, 278, 116, 127, 154, 105, 153, 275, 217] is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
[[165, 132, 278, 116, 123, 154, 105, 153, 275, 217]] (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [165, 132, 278, 116, 127, 154, 105, 153, 275, 217] to [165, 132, 278, 116, 123, 154, 105, 153, 275, 217].
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [165, 132, 278, 116, 127, 154, 105, 153, 275, 217] to [165, 132, 278, 116, 123, 154, 105, 153, 275, 217]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
