The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[27, 22, 27, 26, 27, 37, 27, 36, 32, 24]
 - p=[138, 287, 195, 251, 167, 144, 189, 281, 154, 280]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[138, 287, 195, 251, 167, 144, 189, 281, 154, 280] (keep in mind that d=[27, 22, 27, 26, 27, 37, 27, 36, 32, 24], to grasp the whole situation).
The {winning move =} is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
{next_ps} (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [138, 287, 195, 251, 167, 144, 189, 281, 154, 280] to [138, 287, 195, 251, 167, 144, 170, 281, 154, 280].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
