The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[28, 31, 29, 27, 25, 21, 24, 37, 33, 27]
 - p=[210, 114, 132, 185, 204, 149, 255, 135, 229, 159]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:

Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
