The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[34, 21, 21, 24, 29, 28, 36, 36, 28, 25]
 - p=[134, 181, 254, 183, 186, 186, 294, 203, 279, 170]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[134, 181, 254, 183, 186, 186, 294, 203, 279, 170] (keep in mind that d=[34, 21, 21, 24, 29, 28, 36, 36, 28, 25], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [134, 181, 254, 183, 186, 186, 294, 203, 279, 170] to [134, 181, 254, 183, 186, 186, 283, 203, 279, 170].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
