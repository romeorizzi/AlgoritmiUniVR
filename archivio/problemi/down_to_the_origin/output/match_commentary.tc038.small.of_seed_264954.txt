The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[4, 4, 4, 5, 2, 6, 3, 3, 6, 3]
 - p=[14, 17, 9, 14, 6, 16, 4, 20, 4, 4]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[14, 17, 9, 14, 6, 16, 4, 20, 4, 4] (keep in mind that d=[4, 4, 4, 5, 2, 6, 3, 3, 6, 3], to grasp the whole situation).
The winning move [12, 17, 9, 14, 6, 16, 4, 20, 4, 4] is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
[[14, 17, 9, 14, 6, 16, 4, 20, 2, 4]] (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [14, 17, 9, 14, 6, 16, 4, 20, 4, 4] to [14, 17, 9, 14, 6, 16, 4, 20, 2, 4].
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [14, 17, 9, 14, 6, 16, 4, 20, 4, 4] to [14, 17, 9, 14, 6, 16, 4, 20, 2, 4]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
