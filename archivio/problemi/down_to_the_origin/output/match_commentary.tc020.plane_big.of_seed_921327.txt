The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[35155, 49599]
 - p=[96364, 42387]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[96364, 42387] (keep in mind that d=[35155, 49599], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [96364, 42387] to [96364, 26052].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[96364, 26052] (keep in mind that d=[35155, 49599], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [96364, 26052] to [61209, 26052].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:

The server reluctancty moves from [26052, 26052] to [0, 26052].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 26052] (keep in mind that d=[35155, 49599], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 26052] to [0, 0].
