The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=1
 - d=[17]
 - p=[267]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[267] (keep in mind that d=[17], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [267] to [252].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
