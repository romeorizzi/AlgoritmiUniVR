The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[36, 34, 31, 28, 25, 29, 32, 35, 28, 33]
 - p=[209, 167, 155, 240, 140, 166, 118, 190, 119, 181]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[209, 167, 155, 240, 140, 166, 118, 190, 119, 181] (keep in mind that d=[36, 34, 31, 28, 25, 29, 32, 35, 28, 33], to grasp the whole situation).
The winning move [188, 167, 155, 240, 140, 166, 118, 190, 119, 181] is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
[[209, 167, 155, 240, 140, 166, 118, 190, 119, 152]] (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [209, 167, 155, 240, 140, 166, 118, 190, 119, 181] to [209, 167, 155, 240, 140, 166, 118, 190, 119, 152].
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [209, 167, 155, 240, 140, 166, 118, 190, 119, 181] to [209, 167, 155, 240, 140, 166, 118, 190, 119, 152]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1] (keep in mind that d=[36, 34, 31, 28, 25, 29, 32, 35, 28, 33], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1] to [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].
