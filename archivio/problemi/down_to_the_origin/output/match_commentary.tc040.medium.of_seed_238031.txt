The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[34, 23, 25, 31, 36, 26, 25, 22, 31, 25]
 - p=[171, 126, 178, 106, 291, 198, 251, 109, 176, 123]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[171, 126, 178, 106, 291, 198, 251, 109, 176, 123] (keep in mind that d=[34, 23, 25, 31, 36, 26, 25, 22, 31, 25], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [171, 126, 178, 106, 291, 198, 251, 109, 176, 123] to [171, 126, 178, 106, 274, 198, 251, 109, 176, 123].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
