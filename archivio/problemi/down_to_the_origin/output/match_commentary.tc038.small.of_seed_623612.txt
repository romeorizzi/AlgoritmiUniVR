The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[2, 5, 4, 5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 2, 3]
 - p=[4, 4, 16, 17, 19, 18, 12, 13, 12, 17]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[4, 4, 16, 17, 19, 18, 12, 13, 12, 17] (keep in mind that d=[2, 5, 4, 5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 2, 3], to grasp the whole situation).
The winning move [4, 3, 16, 17, 19, 18, 12, 13, 12, 17] is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
[[4, 4, 16, 17, 19, 18, 12, 8, 12, 17]] (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [4, 4, 16, 17, 19, 18, 12, 13, 12, 17] to [4, 4, 16, 17, 19, 18, 12, 8, 12, 17].
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [4, 4, 16, 17, 19, 18, 12, 13, 12, 17] to [4, 4, 16, 17, 19, 18, 12, 8, 12, 17]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
