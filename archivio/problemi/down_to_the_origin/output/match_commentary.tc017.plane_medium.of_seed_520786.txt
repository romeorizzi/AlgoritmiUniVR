The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[17, 17]
 - p=[69, 62]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[69, 62] (keep in mind that d=[17, 17], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   [[62, 62], [69, 51]]
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [69, 62] to [62, 62]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[62, 62] (keep in mind that d=[17, 17], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [62, 62] to [45, 62].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[45, 62] (keep in mind that d=[17, 17], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   [[45, 45], [44, 62]]
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[45, 45] (keep in mind that d=[17, 17], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [45, 45] to [28, 45].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[28, 45] (keep in mind that d=[17, 17], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   [[28, 28], [27, 45]]
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[28, 28] (keep in mind that d=[17, 17], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [28, 28] to [11, 28].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[11, 28] (keep in mind that d=[17, 17], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   [[10, 28], [11, 11]]
# The server is now facing the position:

The server reluctancty moves from [10, 28] to [0, 28].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 28] (keep in mind that d=[17, 17], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 28] to [0, 18].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 18] (keep in mind that d=[17, 17], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 18] to [0, 1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 1] (keep in mind that d=[17, 17], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 1] to [0, 0].
