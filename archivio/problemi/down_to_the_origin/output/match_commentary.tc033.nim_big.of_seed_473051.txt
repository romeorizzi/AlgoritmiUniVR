The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[37677, 50640, 29260, 26950, 32419, 40397, 33629, 39630, 50919, 45780]
 - p=[196990, 121754, 96270, 137797, 140798, 183469, 179522, 127346, 94774, 169818]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:

 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   {next_ps}
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
