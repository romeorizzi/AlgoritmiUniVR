The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[47516, 17406]
 - p=[74917, 57068]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[74917, 57068] (keep in mind that d=[47516, 17406], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [74917, 57068] to [52364, 57068].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[52364, 57068] (keep in mind that d=[47516, 17406], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [52364, 57068] to [4848, 57068].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[4848, 57068] (keep in mind that d=[47516, 17406], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   {next_ps}
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[4848, 39662] (keep in mind that d=[47516, 17406], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [4848, 39662] to [0, 39662].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 39662] (keep in mind that d=[47516, 17406], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 39662] to [0, 34814].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 34814] (keep in mind that d=[47516, 17406], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 34814] to [0, 17408].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 17408] (keep in mind that d=[47516, 17406], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 17408] to [0, 17407].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 17407] (keep in mind that d=[47516, 17406], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 17407] to [0, 1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 1] (keep in mind that d=[47516, 17406], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 1] to [0, 0].
