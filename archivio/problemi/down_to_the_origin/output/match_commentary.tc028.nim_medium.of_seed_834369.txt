The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[28, 15, 27, 24, 12, 15, 17, 14, 16, 16]
 - p=[176, 229, 125, 132, 215, 143, 178, 123, 101, 221]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
