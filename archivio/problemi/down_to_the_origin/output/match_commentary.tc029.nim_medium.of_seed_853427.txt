The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[28, 25, 24, 16, 23, 28, 13, 13, 22, 29]
 - p=[160, 259, 153, 290, 149, 113, 181, 258, 282, 144]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[160, 259, 153, 290, 149, 113, 181, 258, 282, 144] (keep in mind that d=[28, 25, 24, 16, 23, 28, 13, 13, 22, 29], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   {next_ps}
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
