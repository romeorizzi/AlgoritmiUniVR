The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[43344, 22619, 41221, 22175, 43978, 27194, 28441, 36128, 47623, 33890]
 - p=[161648, 195912, 105055, 182073, 91756, 91756, 196038, 126669, 184007, 116689]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[161648, 195912, 105055, 182073, 91756, 91756, 196038, 126669, 184007, 116689] (keep in mind that d=[43344, 22619, 41221, 22175, 43978, 27194, 28441, 36128, 47623, 33890], to grasp the whole situation).
The {winning move =} is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
{next_ps} (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [161648, 195912, 105055, 182073, 91756, 91756, 196038, 126669, 184007, 116689] to [161648, 195912, 105055, 182073, 91756, 91756, 196038, 126669, 158482, 116689].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
