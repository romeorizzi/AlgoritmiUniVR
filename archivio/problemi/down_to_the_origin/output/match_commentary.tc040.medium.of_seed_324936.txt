The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[23, 29, 23, 34, 37, 37, 21, 24, 35, 27]
 - p=[176, 226, 153, 198, 146, 198, 145, 176, 246, 244]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[176, 226, 153, 198, 146, 198, 145, 176, 246, 244] (keep in mind that d=[23, 29, 23, 34, 37, 37, 21, 24, 35, 27], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   [[176, 226, 153, 198, 146, 184, 145, 176, 246, 244], [176, 226, 153, 198, 122, 198, 145, 176, 246, 244]]
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [176, 226, 153, 198, 146, 198, 145, 176, 246, 244] to [176, 226, 153, 198, 146, 184, 145, 176, 246, 244]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
