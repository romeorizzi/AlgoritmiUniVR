The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[14, 13, 15, 13, 16, 16, 17, 19, 23, 18]
 - p=[100, 247, 222, 257, 201, 139, 222, 162, 188, 171]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[100, 247, 222, 257, 201, 139, 222, 162, 188, 171] (keep in mind that d=[14, 13, 15, 13, 16, 16, 17, 19, 23, 18], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [100, 247, 222, 257, 201, 139, 222, 162, 188, 171] to [100, 247, 222, 257, 201, 139, 222, 162, 169, 171].
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [100, 247, 222, 257, 201, 139, 222, 162, 188, 171] to [100, 247, 222, 257, 201, 139, 222, 162, 169, 171]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1] (keep in mind that d=[14, 13, 15, 13, 16, 16, 17, 19, 23, 18], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1] to [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].
