The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[6, 3, 4, 2, 5, 6, 2, 6, 3, 5]
 - p=[6, 19, 15, 18, 7, 9, 9, 4, 6, 10]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[6, 19, 15, 18, 7, 9, 9, 4, 6, 10] (keep in mind that d=[6, 3, 4, 2, 5, 6, 2, 6, 3, 5], to grasp the whole situation).
The winning move [2, 19, 15, 18, 7, 9, 9, 4, 6, 10] is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
[[6, 19, 15, 18, 7, 9, 9, 0, 6, 10]] (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [6, 19, 15, 18, 7, 9, 9, 4, 6, 10] to [6, 19, 15, 18, 7, 9, 9, 0, 6, 10].
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [6, 19, 15, 18, 7, 9, 9, 4, 6, 10] to [6, 19, 15, 18, 7, 9, 9, 0, 6, 10]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
