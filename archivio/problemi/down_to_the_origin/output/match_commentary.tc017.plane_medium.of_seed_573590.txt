The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[19, 14]
 - p=[87, 52]
our disinterested advice would be to go second.

The problem solver wants to go second. Ok, I'll take the first move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[87, 52] (keep in mind that d=[19, 14], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [87, 52] to [68, 52].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[68, 52] (keep in mind that d=[19, 14], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   {next_ps}
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[68, 38] (keep in mind that d=[19, 14], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [68, 38] to [49, 38].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[49, 38] (keep in mind that d=[19, 14], to grasp the whole situation).

The server reluctancty moves from [10, 10] to [0, 10].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 10] (keep in mind that d=[19, 14], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 10] to [0, 0].
