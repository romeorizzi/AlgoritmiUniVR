The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[31, 37, 33, 34, 23, 28, 23, 25, 31, 22]
 - p=[220, 176, 259, 121, 234, 176, 234, 231, 129, 105]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[220, 176, 259, 121, 234, 176, 234, 231, 129, 105] (keep in mind that d=[31, 37, 33, 34, 23, 28, 23, 25, 31, 22], to grasp the whole situation).
The winning move [196, 176, 259, 121, 234, 176, 234, 231, 129, 105] is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
[[220, 176, 259, 121, 234, 176, 234, 231, 129, 90]] (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [220, 176, 259, 121, 234, 176, 234, 231, 129, 105] to [220, 176, 259, 121, 234, 176, 234, 231, 129, 90].
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [220, 176, 259, 121, 234, 176, 234, 231, 129, 105] to [220, 176, 259, 121, 234, 176, 234, 231, 129, 90]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
