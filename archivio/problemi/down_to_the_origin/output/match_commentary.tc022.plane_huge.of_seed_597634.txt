The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[4694185, 4659813]
 - p=[53674823, 99342364]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[53674823, 99342364] (keep in mind that d=[4694185, 4659813], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   [[53122316, 99342364], [53674823, 95235057]]
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [53674823, 99342364] to [53122316, 99342364]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
