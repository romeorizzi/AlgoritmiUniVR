The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[6, 4]
 - p=[7, 9]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[7, 9] (keep in mind that d=[6, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   [[4, 9], [7, 5]]
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [7, 9] to [4, 9]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[4, 9] (keep in mind that d=[6, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [4, 9] to [0, 9].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 9] (keep in mind that d=[6, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 9] to [0, 5].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 5] (keep in mind that d=[6, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 5] to [0, 1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 1] (keep in mind that d=[6, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 1] to [0, 0].
