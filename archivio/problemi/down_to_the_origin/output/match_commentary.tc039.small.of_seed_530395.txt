The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[6, 2, 4, 3, 3, 4, 5, 3, 4, 5]
 - p=[15, 18, 7, 10, 4, 12, 16, 15, 7, 4]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[15, 18, 7, 10, 4, 12, 16, 15, 7, 4] (keep in mind that d=[6, 2, 4, 3, 3, 4, 5, 3, 4, 5], to grasp the whole situation).
The winning move [10, 18, 7, 10, 4, 12, 16, 15, 7, 4] is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
[[15, 18, 7, 10, 4, 10, 16, 15, 7, 4]] (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [15, 18, 7, 10, 4, 12, 16, 15, 7, 4] to [15, 18, 7, 10, 4, 10, 16, 15, 7, 4].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
