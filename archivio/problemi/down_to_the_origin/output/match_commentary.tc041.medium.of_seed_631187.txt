The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[25, 30, 31, 28, 23, 35, 34, 21, 21, 28]
 - p=[193, 188, 125, 138, 131, 159, 194, 207, 244, 223]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[193, 188, 125, 138, 131, 159, 194, 207, 244, 223] (keep in mind that d=[25, 30, 31, 28, 23, 35, 34, 21, 21, 28], to grasp the whole situation).

Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
