The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[29, 26, 33, 31, 31, 33, 24, 31, 34, 36]
 - p=[224, 278, 224, 159, 183, 140, 265, 161, 122, 126]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[224, 278, 224, 159, 183, 140, 265, 161, 122, 126] (keep in mind that d=[29, 26, 33, 31, 31, 33, 24, 31, 34, 36], to grasp the whole situation).
The winning move [210, 278, 224, 159, 183, 140, 265, 161, 122, 126] is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
[[224, 278, 224, 159, 183, 140, 251, 161, 122, 126]] (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [224, 278, 224, 159, 183, 140, 265, 161, 122, 126] to [224, 278, 224, 159, 183, 140, 251, 161, 122, 126].
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [224, 278, 224, 159, 183, 140, 265, 161, 122, 126] to [224, 278, 224, 159, 183, 140, 251, 161, 122, 126]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
