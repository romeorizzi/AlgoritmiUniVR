The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[17, 17]
 - p=[83, 55]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[83, 55] (keep in mind that d=[17, 17], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   [[73, 55], [83, 47]]
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [83, 55] to [73, 55]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[73, 55] (keep in mind that d=[17, 17], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [73, 55] to [56, 55].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[56, 55] (keep in mind that d=[17, 17], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   [[56, 38], [55, 55]]
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[56, 38] (keep in mind that d=[17, 17], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [56, 38] to [39, 38].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[39, 38] (keep in mind that d=[17, 17], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   [[39, 21], [38, 38]]
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[39, 21] (keep in mind that d=[17, 17], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [39, 21] to [22, 21].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[22, 21] (keep in mind that d=[17, 17], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   [[22, 4], [21, 21]]
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[22, 4] (keep in mind that d=[17, 17], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [22, 4] to [5, 4].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[5, 4] (keep in mind that d=[17, 17], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [5, 4] to [4, 4].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[4, 4] (keep in mind that d=[17, 17], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [4, 4] to [0, 4].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 4] (keep in mind that d=[17, 17], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 4] to [0, 0].
