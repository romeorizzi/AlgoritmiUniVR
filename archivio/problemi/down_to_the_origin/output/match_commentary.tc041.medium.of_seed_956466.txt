The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[25, 37, 28, 30, 26, 26, 24, 30, 34, 32]
 - p=[152, 248, 280, 227, 229, 178, 220, 198, 239, 272]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[152, 248, 280, 227, 229, 178, 220, 198, 239, 272] (keep in mind that d=[25, 37, 28, 30, 26, 26, 24, 30, 34, 32], to grasp the whole situation).
The {winning move =} is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
{next_ps} (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [152, 248, 280, 227, 229, 178, 220, 198, 239, 272] to [152, 248, 256, 227, 229, 178, 220, 198, 239, 272].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
