The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[44065, 43284, 25679, 26248, 29252, 28807, 39885, 49232, 22550, 41782]
 - p=[92361, 109548, 99317, 129191, 169379, 127601, 177706, 155282, 193142, 160387]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:

The winning move [92361, 109548, 99317, 129191, 169379, 127601, 156047, 155282, 193142, 160387] is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
[[92361, 80426, 99317, 129191, 169379, 127601, 177706, 155282, 193142, 160387]] (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [92361, 109548, 99317, 129191, 169379, 127601, 177706, 155282, 193142, 160387] to [92361, 80426, 99317, 129191, 169379, 127601, 177706, 155282, 193142, 160387].
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [92361, 109548, 99317, 129191, 169379, 127601, 177706, 155282, 193142, 160387] to [92361, 80426, 99317, 129191, 169379, 127601, 177706, 155282, 193142, 160387]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
