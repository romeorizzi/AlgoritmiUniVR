The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[6, 3, 5, 6, 4, 3, 3, 6, 3, 6]
 - p=[20, 6, 12, 9, 18, 18, 20, 13, 13, 14]
our disinterested advice would be to go second.

The problem solver wants to go second. Ok, I'll take the first move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[20, 6, 12, 9, 18, 18, 20, 13, 13, 14] (keep in mind that d=[6, 3, 5, 6, 4, 3, 3, 6, 3, 6], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [20, 6, 12, 9, 18, 18, 20, 13, 13, 14] to [14, 6, 12, 9, 18, 18, 20, 13, 13, 14].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:

The winning move [14, 6, 12, 4, 18, 18, 20, 13, 13, 14] is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
[[13, 6, 12, 9, 18, 18, 20, 13, 13, 14]] (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [14, 6, 12, 9, 18, 18, 20, 13, 13, 14] to [13, 6, 12, 9, 18, 18, 20, 13, 13, 14].
Move 2: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [14, 6, 12, 9, 18, 18, 20, 13, 13, 14] to [13, 6, 12, 9, 18, 18, 20, 13, 13, 14]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
