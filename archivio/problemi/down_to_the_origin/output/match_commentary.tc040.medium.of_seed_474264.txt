The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[37, 24, 21, 32, 34, 23, 35, 27, 35, 27]
 - p=[176, 140, 252, 230, 156, 124, 218, 187, 295, 229]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[176, 140, 252, 230, 156, 124, 218, 187, 295, 229] (keep in mind that d=[37, 24, 21, 32, 34, 23, 35, 27, 35, 27], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   [[148, 140, 252, 230, 156, 124, 218, 187, 295, 229], [176, 140, 252, 224, 156, 124, 218, 187, 295, 229]]
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [176, 140, 252, 230, 156, 124, 218, 187, 295, 229] to [148, 140, 252, 230, 156, 124, 218, 187, 295, 229]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
