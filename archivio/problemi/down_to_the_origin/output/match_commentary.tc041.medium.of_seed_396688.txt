The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[37, 28, 22, 24, 24, 31, 27, 35, 28, 29]
 - p=[153, 279, 290, 148, 241, 176, 267, 109, 153, 225]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
