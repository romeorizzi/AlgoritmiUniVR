The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[3, 2, 2, 5, 5, 2, 2, 2, 4, 6]
 - p=[15, 5, 6, 11, 7, 11, 20, 16, 16, 5]
our disinterested advice would be to go second.

The problem solver wants to go second. Ok, I'll take the first move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
