The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[6, 2]
 - p=[15, 18]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[15, 18] (keep in mind that d=[6, 2], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   {next_ps}
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[14, 18] (keep in mind that d=[6, 2], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [14, 18] to [8, 18].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[8, 18] (keep in mind that d=[6, 2], to grasp the whole situation).

The server reluctancty moves from [8, 16] to [2, 16].

The server reluctancty moves from [1, 16] to [0, 16].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:

The problem solver moves from [0, 10] to [0, 9].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 9] (keep in mind that d=[6, 2], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 9] to [0, 7].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 7] (keep in mind that d=[6, 2], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 7] to [0, 6].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 6] (keep in mind that d=[6, 2], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 6] to [0, 4].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 4] (keep in mind that d=[6, 2], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 4] to [0, 3].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 3] (keep in mind that d=[6, 2], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 3] to [0, 1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 1] (keep in mind that d=[6, 2], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 1] to [0, 0].
