The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[3, 4, 4, 5, 2, 6, 4, 4, 4, 2]
 - p=[11, 19, 15, 7, 19, 6, 14, 17, 11, 9]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[11, 19, 15, 7, 19, 6, 14, 17, 11, 9] (keep in mind that d=[3, 4, 4, 5, 2, 6, 4, 4, 4, 2], to grasp the whole situation).
The winning move [11, 19, 15, 7, 19, 0, 14, 17, 11, 9] is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
[[11, 17, 15, 7, 19, 6, 14, 17, 11, 9]] (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [11, 19, 15, 7, 19, 6, 14, 17, 11, 9] to [11, 17, 15, 7, 19, 6, 14, 17, 11, 9].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
