The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[14, 11]
 - p=[55, 52]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[55, 52] (keep in mind that d=[14, 11], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   [[49, 52], [55, 46]]
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [55, 52] to [49, 52]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[49, 52] (keep in mind that d=[14, 11], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [49, 52] to [35, 52].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[35, 52] (keep in mind that d=[14, 11], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[35, 41] (keep in mind that d=[14, 11], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [35, 41] to [21, 41].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[21, 41] (keep in mind that d=[14, 11], to grasp the whole situation).

The server reluctancty moves from [21, 30] to [7, 30].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[7, 30] (keep in mind that d=[14, 11], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:

The server reluctancty moves from [6, 30] to [0, 30].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 30] (keep in mind that d=[14, 11], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 30] to [0, 24].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 24] (keep in mind that d=[14, 11], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 24] to [0, 13].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 13] (keep in mind that d=[14, 11], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 13] to [0, 12].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 12] (keep in mind that d=[14, 11], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 12] to [0, 1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 1] (keep in mind that d=[14, 11], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 1] to [0, 0].
