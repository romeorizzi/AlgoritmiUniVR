The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[5, 6]
 - p=[10, 15]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[10, 15] (keep in mind that d=[5, 6], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   [[10, 11], [7, 15]]
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [10, 15] to [10, 11]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[10, 11] (keep in mind that d=[5, 6], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [10, 11] to [5, 11].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[5, 11] (keep in mind that d=[5, 6], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   [[5, 5], [4, 11]]
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[5, 5] (keep in mind that d=[5, 6], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [5, 5] to [0, 5].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 5] (keep in mind that d=[5, 6], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 5] to [0, 0].
