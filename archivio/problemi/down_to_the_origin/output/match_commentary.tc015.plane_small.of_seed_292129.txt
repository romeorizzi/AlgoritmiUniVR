The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[4, 2]
 - p=[11, 4]
our disinterested advice would be to go second.

The problem solver wants to go second. Ok, I'll take the first move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[11, 4] (keep in mind that d=[4, 2], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [11, 4] to [7, 4].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[7, 4] (keep in mind that d=[4, 2], to grasp the whole situation).
The winning move [7, 2] is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
[[6, 4]] (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [7, 4] to [6, 4].
Move 2: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [7, 4] to [6, 4]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[6, 4] (keep in mind that d=[4, 2], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [6, 4] to [2, 4].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[2, 4] (keep in mind that d=[4, 2], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [2, 4] to [2, 2].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[2, 2] (keep in mind that d=[4, 2], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [2, 2] to [0, 2].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 2] (keep in mind that d=[4, 2], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 2] to [0, 0].
