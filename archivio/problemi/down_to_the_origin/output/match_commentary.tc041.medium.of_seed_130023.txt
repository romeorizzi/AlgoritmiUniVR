The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[26, 36, 35, 33, 37, 25, 27, 30, 26, 34]
 - p=[264, 120, 272, 230, 120, 194, 123, 273, 235, 173]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[264, 120, 272, 230, 120, 194, 123, 273, 235, 173] (keep in mind that d=[26, 36, 35, 33, 37, 25, 27, 30, 26, 34], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [264, 120, 272, 230, 120, 194, 123, 273, 235, 173] to [264, 120, 272, 230, 120, 194, 123, 273, 235, 165].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
