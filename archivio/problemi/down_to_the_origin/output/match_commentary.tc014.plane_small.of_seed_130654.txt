The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[5, 5]
 - p=[10, 17]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[10, 17] (keep in mind that d=[5, 5], to grasp the whole situation).
The winning move [5, 17] is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
[[10, 16]] (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [10, 17] to [10, 16].
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [10, 17] to [10, 16]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[10, 16] (keep in mind that d=[5, 5], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [10, 16] to [5, 16].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[5, 16] (keep in mind that d=[5, 5], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [5, 16] to [4, 16].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[4, 16] (keep in mind that d=[5, 5], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [4, 16] to [0, 16].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 16] (keep in mind that d=[5, 5], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 16] to [0, 12].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 12] (keep in mind that d=[5, 5], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 12] to [0, 7].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 7] (keep in mind that d=[5, 5], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 7] to [0, 6].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 6] (keep in mind that d=[5, 5], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 6] to [0, 1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 1] (keep in mind that d=[5, 5], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 1] to [0, 0].
