The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[4, 6]
 - p=[6, 4]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[6, 4] (keep in mind that d=[4, 6], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   [[6, 1], [4, 4]]
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [6, 4] to [6, 1]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[6, 1] (keep in mind that d=[4, 6], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [6, 1] to [2, 1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[2, 1] (keep in mind that d=[4, 6], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [2, 1] to [1, 1].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[1, 1] (keep in mind that d=[4, 6], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [1, 1] to [0, 1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 1] (keep in mind that d=[4, 6], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 1] to [0, 0].
