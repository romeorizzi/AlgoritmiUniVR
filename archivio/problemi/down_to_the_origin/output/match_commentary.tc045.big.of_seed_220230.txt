The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[31292, 27800, 28798, 43627, 25114, 49345, 50757, 45785, 27574, 24823]
 - p=[121958, 106850, 198221, 169673, 108183, 187772, 150547, 136933, 178837, 140831]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:

 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   {next_ps}
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
