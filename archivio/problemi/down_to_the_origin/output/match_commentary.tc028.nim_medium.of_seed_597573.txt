The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[25, 19, 16, 13, 14, 17, 17, 26, 24, 21]
 - p=[247, 114, 229, 171, 262, 268, 108, 286, 190, 221]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[247, 114, 229, 171, 262, 268, 108, 286, 190, 221] (keep in mind that d=[25, 19, 16, 13, 14, 17, 17, 26, 24, 21], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:

Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
