The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[16, 22, 16, 27, 24, 18, 24, 23, 21, 24]
 - p=[232, 121, 224, 129, 283, 123, 182, 120, 249, 167]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[232, 121, 224, 129, 283, 123, 182, 120, 249, 167] (keep in mind that d=[16, 22, 16, 27, 24, 18, 24, 23, 21, 24], to grasp the whole situation).
The {winning move =} is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
{next_ps} (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [232, 121, 224, 129, 283, 123, 182, 120, 249, 167] to [232, 121, 224, 129, 283, 123, 158, 120, 249, 167].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
