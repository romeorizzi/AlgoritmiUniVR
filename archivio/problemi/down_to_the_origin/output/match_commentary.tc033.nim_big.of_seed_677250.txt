The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[29799, 21453, 46362, 22973, 34126, 37264, 28272, 44649, 45878, 46146]
 - p=[199804, 100623, 124443, 174693, 128316, 157523, 128407, 102026, 138403, 122809]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[199804, 100623, 124443, 174693, 128316, 157523, 128407, 102026, 138403, 122809] (keep in mind that d=[29799, 21453, 46362, 22973, 34126, 37264, 28272, 44649, 45878, 46146], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   {next_ps}
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
