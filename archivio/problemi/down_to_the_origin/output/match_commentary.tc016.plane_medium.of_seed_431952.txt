The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[17, 10]
 - p=[68, 64]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[68, 64] (keep in mind that d=[17, 10], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [68, 64] to [63, 64].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[63, 64] (keep in mind that d=[17, 10], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [63, 64] to [46, 64].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[46, 64] (keep in mind that d=[17, 10], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   {next_ps}
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[46, 54] (keep in mind that d=[17, 10], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [46, 54] to [29, 54].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[29, 54] (keep in mind that d=[17, 10], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [29, 54] to [28, 54].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[28, 54] (keep in mind that d=[17, 10], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [28, 54] to [11, 54].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[11, 54] (keep in mind that d=[17, 10], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [11, 54] to [10, 54].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[10, 54] (keep in mind that d=[17, 10], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [10, 54] to [0, 54].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 54] (keep in mind that d=[17, 10], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 54] to [0, 44].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 44] (keep in mind that d=[17, 10], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 44] to [0, 34].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 34] (keep in mind that d=[17, 10], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 34] to [0, 33].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 33] (keep in mind that d=[17, 10], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 33] to [0, 23].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 23] (keep in mind that d=[17, 10], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 23] to [0, 22].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 22] (keep in mind that d=[17, 10], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 22] to [0, 12].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 12] (keep in mind that d=[17, 10], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 12] to [0, 11].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 11] (keep in mind that d=[17, 10], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 11] to [0, 1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 1] (keep in mind that d=[17, 10], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 1] to [0, 0].
