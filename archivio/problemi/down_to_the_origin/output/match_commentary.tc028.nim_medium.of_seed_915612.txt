The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[17, 23, 18, 24, 15, 13, 27, 19, 23, 22]
 - p=[158, 157, 127, 107, 192, 132, 226, 185, 136, 283]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[158, 157, 127, 107, 192, 132, 226, 185, 136, 283] (keep in mind that d=[17, 23, 18, 24, 15, 13, 27, 19, 23, 22], to grasp the whole situation).
The {winning move =} is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
{next_ps} (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [158, 157, 127, 107, 192, 132, 226, 185, 136, 283] to [158, 138, 127, 107, 192, 132, 226, 185, 136, 283].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
