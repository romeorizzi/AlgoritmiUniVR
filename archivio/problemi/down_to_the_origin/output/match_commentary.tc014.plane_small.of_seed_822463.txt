The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[2, 6]
 - p=[19, 10]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[19, 10] (keep in mind that d=[2, 6], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [19, 10] to [19, 8].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[19, 8] (keep in mind that d=[2, 6], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [19, 8] to [17, 8].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[17, 8] (keep in mind that d=[2, 6], to grasp the whole situation).
The {winning move =} is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
{next_ps} (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [17, 8] to [17, 2].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[17, 2] (keep in mind that d=[2, 6], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [17, 2] to [15, 2].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[15, 2] (keep in mind that d=[2, 6], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [15, 2] to [14, 2].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[14, 2] (keep in mind that d=[2, 6], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [14, 2] to [12, 2].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[12, 2] (keep in mind that d=[2, 6], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [12, 2] to [12, 0].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[12, 0] (keep in mind that d=[2, 6], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [12, 0] to [10, 0].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[10, 0] (keep in mind that d=[2, 6], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [10, 0] to [9, 0].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[9, 0] (keep in mind that d=[2, 6], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [9, 0] to [7, 0].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[7, 0] (keep in mind that d=[2, 6], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [7, 0] to [6, 0].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[6, 0] (keep in mind that d=[2, 6], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [6, 0] to [4, 0].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[4, 0] (keep in mind that d=[2, 6], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [4, 0] to [3, 0].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[3, 0] (keep in mind that d=[2, 6], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [3, 0] to [1, 0].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[1, 0] (keep in mind that d=[2, 6], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [1, 0] to [0, 0].
