The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[28, 29, 19, 16, 15, 13, 16, 28, 29, 14]
 - p=[208, 103, 231, 126, 288, 231, 182, 235, 147, 153]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[208, 103, 231, 126, 288, 231, 182, 235, 147, 153] (keep in mind that d=[28, 29, 19, 16, 15, 13, 16, 28, 29, 14], to grasp the whole situation).

Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
