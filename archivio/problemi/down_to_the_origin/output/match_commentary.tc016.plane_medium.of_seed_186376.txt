The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[10, 19]
 - p=[97, 53]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[97, 53] (keep in mind that d=[10, 19], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [97, 53] to [97, 49].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[97, 49] (keep in mind that d=[10, 19], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [97, 49] to [87, 49].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[87, 49] (keep in mind that d=[10, 19], to grasp the whole situation).
The {winning move =} is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
{next_ps} (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [87, 49] to [86, 49].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[86, 49] (keep in mind that d=[10, 19], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [86, 49] to [76, 49].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[76, 49] (keep in mind that d=[10, 19], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [76, 49] to [76, 30].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[76, 30] (keep in mind that d=[10, 19], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [76, 30] to [66, 30].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:

The problem solver moves from [46, 1] to [45, 1].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[45, 1] (keep in mind that d=[10, 19], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [45, 1] to [35, 1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[35, 1] (keep in mind that d=[10, 19], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [35, 1] to [34, 1].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[34, 1] (keep in mind that d=[10, 19], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [34, 1] to [24, 1].

The problem solver moves from [13, 1] to [12, 1].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[12, 1] (keep in mind that d=[10, 19], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [12, 1] to [2, 1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[2, 1] (keep in mind that d=[10, 19], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [2, 1] to [1, 1].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[1, 1] (keep in mind that d=[10, 19], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [1, 1] to [0, 1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 1] (keep in mind that d=[10, 19], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 1] to [0, 0].
