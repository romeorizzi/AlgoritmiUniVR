The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[33813, 4737]
 - p=[71572, 39738]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[71572, 39738] (keep in mind that d=[33813, 4737], to grasp the whole situation).
The winning move [69462, 39738] is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
[[71572, 37110]] (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [71572, 39738] to [71572, 37110].
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [71572, 39738] to [71572, 37110]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
