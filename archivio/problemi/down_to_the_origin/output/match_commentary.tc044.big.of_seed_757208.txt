The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[26185, 28878, 24445, 37549, 39741, 25993, 49146, 49778, 45446, 33950]
 - p=[109681, 148465, 154638, 133241, 194625, 190393, 100290, 174364, 178589, 166462]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:

 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   {next_ps}
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
