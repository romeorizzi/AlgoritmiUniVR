The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[17, 13]
 - p=[64, 96]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[64, 96] (keep in mind that d=[17, 13], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   [[48, 96], [64, 94]]
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [64, 96] to [48, 96]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[48, 96] (keep in mind that d=[17, 13], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [48, 96] to [31, 96].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[31, 96] (keep in mind that d=[17, 13], to grasp the whole situation).

   [[30, 96], [31, 83]]
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[30, 96] (keep in mind that d=[17, 13], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [30, 96] to [13, 96].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
