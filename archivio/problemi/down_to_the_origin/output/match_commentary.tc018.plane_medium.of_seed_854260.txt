The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[10, 18]
 - p=[72, 54]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[72, 54] (keep in mind that d=[10, 18], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [72, 54] to [72, 44].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[72, 44] (keep in mind that d=[10, 18], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [72, 44] to [62, 44].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[62, 44] (keep in mind that d=[10, 18], to grasp the whole situation).
The {winning move =} is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
{next_ps} (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [62, 44] to [62, 26].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[62, 26] (keep in mind that d=[10, 18], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [62, 26] to [52, 26].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[52, 26] (keep in mind that d=[10, 18], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [52, 26] to [52, 8].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[52, 8] (keep in mind that d=[10, 18], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [52, 8] to [42, 8].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[42, 8] (keep in mind that d=[10, 18], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [42, 8] to [41, 8].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[41, 8] (keep in mind that d=[10, 18], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [41, 8] to [31, 8].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[31, 8] (keep in mind that d=[10, 18], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [31, 8] to [30, 8].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[30, 8] (keep in mind that d=[10, 18], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [30, 8] to [20, 8].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[20, 8] (keep in mind that d=[10, 18], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [20, 8] to [19, 8].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[19, 8] (keep in mind that d=[10, 18], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [19, 8] to [9, 8].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[9, 8] (keep in mind that d=[10, 18], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [9, 8] to [8, 8].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[8, 8] (keep in mind that d=[10, 18], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [8, 8] to [0, 8].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 8] (keep in mind that d=[10, 18], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 8] to [0, 0].
