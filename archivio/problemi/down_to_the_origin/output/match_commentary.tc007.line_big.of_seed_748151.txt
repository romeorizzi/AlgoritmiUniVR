The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=1
 - d=[10731]
 - p=[35103]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[35103] (keep in mind that d=[10731], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [35103] to [32196].
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [35103] to [32196]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[32196] (keep in mind that d=[10731], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [32196] to [21465].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[21465] (keep in mind that d=[10731], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [21465] to [21464].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[21464] (keep in mind that d=[10731], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [21464] to [10733].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[10733] (keep in mind that d=[10731], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [10733] to [10732].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[10732] (keep in mind that d=[10731], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [10732] to [1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[1] (keep in mind that d=[10731], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [1] to [0].
