The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[3771818, 3855442]
 - p=[73408791, 47492870]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[73408791, 47492870] (keep in mind that d=[3771818, 3855442], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   [[73408791, 44154103], [72892115, 47492870]]
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [73408791, 47492870] to [73408791, 44154103]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
