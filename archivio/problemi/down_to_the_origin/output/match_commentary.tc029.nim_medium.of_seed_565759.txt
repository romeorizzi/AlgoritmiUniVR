The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[14, 26, 14, 27, 29, 28, 12, 29, 29, 20]
 - p=[102, 231, 121, 101, 261, 273, 283, 259, 111, 264]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:

Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
