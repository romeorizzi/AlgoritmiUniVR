The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=1
 - d=[10184]
 - p=[60865]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[60865] (keep in mind that d=[10184], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [60865] to [50925].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[50925] (keep in mind that d=[10184], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [50925] to [40741].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[40741] (keep in mind that d=[10184], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [40741] to [40740].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[40740] (keep in mind that d=[10184], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [40740] to [30556].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[30556] (keep in mind that d=[10184], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [30556] to [30555].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[30555] (keep in mind that d=[10184], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [30555] to [20371].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[20371] (keep in mind that d=[10184], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [20371] to [20370].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[20370] (keep in mind that d=[10184], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [20370] to [10186].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[10186] (keep in mind that d=[10184], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [10186] to [10185].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[10185] (keep in mind that d=[10184], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [10185] to [1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[1] (keep in mind that d=[10184], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [1] to [0].
