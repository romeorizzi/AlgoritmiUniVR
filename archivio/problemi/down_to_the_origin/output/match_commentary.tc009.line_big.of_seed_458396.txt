The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=1
 - d=[9677]
 - p=[37001]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[37001] (keep in mind that d=[9677], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [37001] to [29034].
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [37001] to [29034]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[29034] (keep in mind that d=[9677], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [29034] to [19357].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[19357] (keep in mind that d=[9677], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [19357] to [19356].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[19356] (keep in mind that d=[9677], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [19356] to [9679].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[9679] (keep in mind that d=[9677], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [9679] to [9678].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[9678] (keep in mind that d=[9677], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [9678] to [1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[1] (keep in mind that d=[9677], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [1] to [0].
