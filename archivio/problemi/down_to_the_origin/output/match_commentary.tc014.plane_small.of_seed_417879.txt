The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[2, 5]
 - p=[15, 5]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[15, 5] (keep in mind that d=[2, 5], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [15, 5] to [15, 0].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[15, 0] (keep in mind that d=[2, 5], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [15, 0] to [13, 0].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[13, 0] (keep in mind that d=[2, 5], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [13, 0] to [12, 0].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[12, 0] (keep in mind that d=[2, 5], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [12, 0] to [10, 0].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[10, 0] (keep in mind that d=[2, 5], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [10, 0] to [9, 0].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[9, 0] (keep in mind that d=[2, 5], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [9, 0] to [7, 0].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[7, 0] (keep in mind that d=[2, 5], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [7, 0] to [6, 0].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[6, 0] (keep in mind that d=[2, 5], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [6, 0] to [4, 0].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[4, 0] (keep in mind that d=[2, 5], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [4, 0] to [3, 0].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[3, 0] (keep in mind that d=[2, 5], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [3, 0] to [1, 0].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[1, 0] (keep in mind that d=[2, 5], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [1, 0] to [0, 0].
