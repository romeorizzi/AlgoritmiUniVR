The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[19, 13, 20, 17, 13, 21, 13, 18, 18, 22]
 - p=[300, 112, 209, 112, 233, 133, 200, 162, 178, 293]
our disinterested advice would be to go second.

The problem solver wants to go second. Ok, I'll take the first move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[300, 112, 209, 112, 233, 133, 200, 162, 178, 293] (keep in mind that d=[19, 13, 20, 17, 13, 21, 13, 18, 18, 22], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [300, 112, 209, 112, 233, 133, 200, 162, 178, 293] to [281, 112, 209, 112, 233, 133, 200, 162, 178, 293].

 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:

Move 2: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [281, 112, 209, 112, 233, 133, 200, 162, 178, 293] to [281, 112, 209, 112, 233, 133, 200, 162, 178, 292]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
