The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[6, 6, 3, 2, 6, 2, 2, 4, 2, 5]
 - p=[11, 12, 15, 11, 5, 7, 17, 12, 15, 4]
our disinterested advice would be to go second.

The problem solver wants to go second. Ok, I'll take the first move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[11, 12, 15, 11, 5, 7, 17, 12, 15, 4] (keep in mind that d=[6, 6, 3, 2, 6, 2, 2, 4, 2, 5], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [11, 12, 15, 11, 5, 7, 17, 12, 15, 4] to [5, 12, 15, 11, 5, 7, 17, 12, 15, 4].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:

 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   [[4, 12, 15, 11, 5, 7, 17, 12, 15, 4], [5, 12, 15, 11, 5, 7, 17, 8, 15, 4], [5, 11, 15, 11, 5, 7, 17, 12, 15, 4], [5, 12, 15, 11, 5, 7, 17, 12, 13, 4], [5, 12, 15, 11, 5, 6, 17, 12, 15, 4], [5, 12, 15, 11, 4, 7, 17, 12, 15, 4], [5, 12, 14, 11, 5, 7, 17, 12, 15, 4]]
Move 2: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [5, 12, 15, 11, 5, 7, 17, 12, 15, 4] to [4, 12, 15, 11, 5, 7, 17, 12, 15, 4]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
