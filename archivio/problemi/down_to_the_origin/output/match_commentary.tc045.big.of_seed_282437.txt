The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[38361, 35304, 30159, 41324, 38730, 50384, 39221, 44974, 38184, 47987]
 - p=[120455, 104531, 175116, 126725, 110645, 109736, 183408, 119318, 156484, 101311]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:

 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   {next_ps}
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
