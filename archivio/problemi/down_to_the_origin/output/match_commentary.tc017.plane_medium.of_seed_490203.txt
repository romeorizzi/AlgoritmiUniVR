The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[17, 17]
 - p=[84, 55]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[84, 55] (keep in mind that d=[17, 17], to grasp the whole situation).
The winning move [73, 55] is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
[[84, 48]] (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [84, 55] to [84, 48].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[84, 48] (keep in mind that d=[17, 17], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [84, 48] to [67, 48].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[67, 48] (keep in mind that d=[17, 17], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [67, 48] to [67, 31].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[67, 31] (keep in mind that d=[17, 17], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [67, 31] to [50, 31].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[50, 31] (keep in mind that d=[17, 17], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [50, 31] to [49, 31].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[49, 31] (keep in mind that d=[17, 17], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [49, 31] to [32, 31].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[32, 31] (keep in mind that d=[17, 17], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [32, 31] to [31, 31].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[31, 31] (keep in mind that d=[17, 17], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [31, 31] to [14, 31].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[14, 31] (keep in mind that d=[17, 17], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [14, 31] to [14, 14].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[14, 14] (keep in mind that d=[17, 17], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [14, 14] to [0, 14].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 14] (keep in mind that d=[17, 17], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 14] to [0, 0].
