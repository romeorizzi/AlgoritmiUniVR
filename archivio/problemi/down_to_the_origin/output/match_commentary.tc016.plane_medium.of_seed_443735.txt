The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[13, 16]
 - p=[82, 82]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[82, 82] (keep in mind that d=[13, 16], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [82, 82] to [82, 80].
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [82, 82] to [82, 80]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[82, 80] (keep in mind that d=[13, 16], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [82, 80] to [69, 80].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[69, 80] (keep in mind that d=[13, 16], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   [[68, 80], [69, 64]]
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[68, 80] (keep in mind that d=[13, 16], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [68, 80] to [55, 80].
