The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[27789, 38349, 45439, 25790, 41704, 31905, 26192, 46503, 34311, 41891]
 - p=[97121, 101978, 183972, 127247, 188471, 180339, 175884, 171990, 168939, 106565]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[97121, 101978, 183972, 127247, 188471, 180339, 175884, 171990, 168939, 106565] (keep in mind that d=[27789, 38349, 45439, 25790, 41704, 31905, 26192, 46503, 34311, 41891], to grasp the whole situation).
The {winning move =} is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
{next_ps} (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [97121, 101978, 183972, 127247, 188471, 180339, 175884, 171990, 168939, 106565] to [97121, 101978, 183972, 123317, 188471, 180339, 175884, 171990, 168939, 106565].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
