The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[26, 23, 35, 34, 35, 28, 30, 31, 37, 37]
 - p=[213, 235, 214, 272, 103, 190, 203, 156, 209, 169]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[213, 235, 214, 272, 103, 190, 203, 156, 209, 169] (keep in mind that d=[26, 23, 35, 34, 35, 28, 30, 31, 37, 37], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   [[213, 235, 214, 272, 103, 190, 203, 156, 185, 169], [213, 235, 196, 272, 103, 190, 203, 156, 209, 169], [213, 235, 214, 272, 103, 190, 203, 156, 209, 149]]
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [213, 235, 214, 272, 103, 190, 203, 156, 209, 169] to [213, 235, 214, 272, 103, 190, 203, 156, 185, 169]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
