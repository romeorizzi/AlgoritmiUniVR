The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[35565, 35684, 36845, 46229, 38939, 32234, 44739, 34978, 21317, 29719]
 - p=[104523, 103997, 131805, 142091, 147483, 154428, 173473, 122056, 139708, 192699]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:

 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   {next_ps}
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
