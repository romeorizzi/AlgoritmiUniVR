The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[41065, 27339, 32421, 44749, 26389, 27136, 38601, 36287, 23985, 40104]
 - p=[107104, 117181, 118329, 183967, 151407, 185336, 112200, 159058, 160505, 150394]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:

The problem solver moves from [107104, 117181, 118329, 183967, 151407, 185336, 112200, 159058, 160505, 150394] to [107104, 117181, 118329, 183967, 151407, 185336, 86982, 159058, 160505, 150394].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
