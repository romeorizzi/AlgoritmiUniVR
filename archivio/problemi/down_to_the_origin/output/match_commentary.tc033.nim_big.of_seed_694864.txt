The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[40052, 39076, 24181, 24442, 25228, 31780, 48008, 34429, 29508, 33380]
 - p=[163701, 159849, 130605, 160624, 92165, 97219, 143245, 112970, 115657, 119261]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:

The problem solver moves from [163701, 159849, 130605, 160624, 92165, 97219, 143245, 112970, 115657, 119261] to [163701, 159849, 130605, 160624, 92165, 97219, 117181, 112970, 115657, 119261].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
