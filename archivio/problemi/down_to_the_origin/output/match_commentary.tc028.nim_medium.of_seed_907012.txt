The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[20, 22, 20, 24, 17, 15, 28, 16, 14, 28]
 - p=[219, 275, 149, 187, 258, 222, 264, 215, 197, 132]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[219, 275, 149, 187, 258, 222, 264, 215, 197, 132] (keep in mind that d=[20, 22, 20, 24, 17, 15, 28, 16, 14, 28], to grasp the whole situation).
The winning move [199, 275, 149, 187, 258, 222, 264, 215, 197, 132] is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
[[219, 275, 149, 187, 258, 221, 264, 215, 197, 132]] (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [219, 275, 149, 187, 258, 222, 264, 215, 197, 132] to [219, 275, 149, 187, 258, 221, 264, 215, 197, 132].
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [219, 275, 149, 187, 258, 222, 264, 215, 197, 132] to [219, 275, 149, 187, 258, 221, 264, 215, 197, 132]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
