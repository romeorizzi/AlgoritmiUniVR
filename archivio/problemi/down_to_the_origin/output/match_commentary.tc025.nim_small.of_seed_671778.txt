The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[6, 6, 4, 2, 3, 5, 3, 5, 4, 2]
 - p=[4, 6, 4, 5, 12, 6, 4, 8, 20, 8]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[4, 6, 4, 5, 12, 6, 4, 8, 20, 8] (keep in mind that d=[6, 6, 4, 2, 3, 5, 3, 5, 4, 2], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   [[4, 6, 4, 5, 12, 6, 4, 8, 19, 8], [4, 2, 4, 5, 12, 6, 4, 8, 20, 8], [0, 6, 4, 5, 12, 6, 4, 8, 20, 8], [4, 6, 0, 5, 12, 6, 4, 8, 20, 8], [4, 6, 4, 5, 12, 4, 4, 8, 20, 8]]
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [4, 6, 4, 5, 12, 6, 4, 8, 20, 8] to [4, 6, 4, 5, 12, 6, 4, 8, 19, 8]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
