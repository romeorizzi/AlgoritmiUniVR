The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[31840, 36561]
 - p=[49482, 72048]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[49482, 72048] (keep in mind that d=[31840, 36561], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [49482, 72048] to [49482, 54203].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[49482, 54203] (keep in mind that d=[31840, 36561], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [49482, 54203] to [17642, 54203].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[17642, 54203] (keep in mind that d=[31840, 36561], to grasp the whole situation).
The {winning move =} is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
{next_ps} (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [17642, 54203] to [17642, 17642].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[17642, 17642] (keep in mind that d=[31840, 36561], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [17642, 17642] to [0, 17642].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 17642] (keep in mind that d=[31840, 36561], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 17642] to [0, 0].
