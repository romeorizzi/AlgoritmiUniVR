The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[48076, 31709, 46029, 48674, 40024, 29818, 24082, 41310, 32011, 46721]
 - p=[153922, 108772, 104737, 181027, 118914, 101188, 182580, 133619, 115753, 109212]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[153922, 108772, 104737, 181027, 118914, 101188, 182580, 133619, 115753, 109212] (keep in mind that d=[48076, 31709, 46029, 48674, 40024, 29818, 24082, 41310, 32011, 46721], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   {next_ps}
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
