The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[25614, 44373, 49851, 24383, 25332, 29238, 29804, 41010, 28761, 27219]
 - p=[165521, 197909, 92128, 171843, 188384, 152318, 105613, 169036, 162244, 193342]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[165521, 197909, 92128, 171843, 188384, 152318, 105613, 169036, 162244, 193342] (keep in mind that d=[25614, 44373, 49851, 24383, 25332, 29238, 29804, 41010, 28761, 27219], to grasp the whole situation).
The {winning move =} is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
{next_ps} (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [165521, 197909, 92128, 171843, 188384, 152318, 105613, 169036, 162244, 193342] to [165521, 197909, 64181, 171843, 188384, 152318, 105613, 169036, 162244, 193342].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
