The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[23, 27, 12, 16, 21, 23, 16, 26, 12, 12]
 - p=[116, 294, 117, 162, 202, 188, 156, 169, 162, 196]
our disinterested advice would be to go second.

The problem solver wants to go second. Ok, I'll take the first move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[116, 294, 117, 162, 202, 188, 156, 169, 162, 196] (keep in mind that d=[23, 27, 12, 16, 21, 23, 16, 26, 12, 12], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [116, 294, 117, 162, 202, 188, 156, 169, 162, 196] to [93, 294, 117, 162, 202, 188, 156, 169, 162, 196].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[93, 294, 117, 162, 202, 188, 156, 169, 162, 196] (keep in mind that d=[23, 27, 12, 16, 21, 23, 16, 26, 12, 12], to grasp the whole situation).
The {winning move =} is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
{next_ps} (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [93, 294, 117, 162, 202, 188, 156, 169, 162, 196] to [93, 294, 117, 162, 181, 188, 156, 169, 162, 196].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
