The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[21543, 25430]
 - p=[29178, 83605]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[29178, 83605] (keep in mind that d=[21543, 25430], to grasp the whole situation).
The {winning move =} is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
{next_ps} (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [29178, 83605] to [28856, 83605].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[28856, 83605] (keep in mind that d=[21543, 25430], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [28856, 83605] to [7313, 83605].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[7313, 83605] (keep in mind that d=[21543, 25430], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [7313, 83605] to [7313, 58175].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[7313, 58175] (keep in mind that d=[21543, 25430], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [7313, 58175] to [0, 58175].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 58175] (keep in mind that d=[21543, 25430], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 58175] to [0, 50862].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 50862] (keep in mind that d=[21543, 25430], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 50862] to [0, 25432].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 25432] (keep in mind that d=[21543, 25430], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 25432] to [0, 25431].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 25431] (keep in mind that d=[21543, 25430], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 25431] to [0, 1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 1] (keep in mind that d=[21543, 25430], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 1] to [0, 0].
