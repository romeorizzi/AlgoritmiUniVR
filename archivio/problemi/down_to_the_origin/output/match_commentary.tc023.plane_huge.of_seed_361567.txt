The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[3138382, 3897288]
 - p=[48472615, 63961766]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[48472615, 63961766] (keep in mind that d=[3138382, 3897288], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   [[45542504, 63961766], [48472615, 63753494]]
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [48472615, 63961766] to [45542504, 63961766]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
