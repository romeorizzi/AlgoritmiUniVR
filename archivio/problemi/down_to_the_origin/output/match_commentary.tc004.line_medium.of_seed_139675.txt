The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=1
 - d=[26]
 - p=[209]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[209] (keep in mind that d=[26], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [209] to [189].
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [209] to [189]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[189] (keep in mind that d=[26], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [189] to [163].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[163] (keep in mind that d=[26], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [163] to [162].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[162] (keep in mind that d=[26], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [162] to [136].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[136] (keep in mind that d=[26], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [136] to [135].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[135] (keep in mind that d=[26], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [135] to [109].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[109] (keep in mind that d=[26], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [109] to [108].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[108] (keep in mind that d=[26], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [108] to [82].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[82] (keep in mind that d=[26], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [82] to [81].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[81] (keep in mind that d=[26], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [81] to [55].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[55] (keep in mind that d=[26], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [55] to [54].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[54] (keep in mind that d=[26], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [54] to [28].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[28] (keep in mind that d=[26], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [28] to [27].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[27] (keep in mind that d=[26], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [27] to [1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[1] (keep in mind that d=[26], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [1] to [0].
