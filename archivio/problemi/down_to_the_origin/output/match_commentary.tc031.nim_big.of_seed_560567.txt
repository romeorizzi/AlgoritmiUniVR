The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[28509, 25618, 31604, 39544, 42910, 43449, 40128, 30357, 30121, 45984]
 - p=[107046, 197996, 180016, 166535, 123619, 177875, 178144, 98247, 125028, 99008]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[107046, 197996, 180016, 166535, 123619, 177875, 178144, 98247, 125028, 99008] (keep in mind that d=[28509, 25618, 31604, 39544, 42910, 43449, 40128, 30357, 30121, 45984], to grasp the whole situation).
The {winning move =} is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
{next_ps} (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [107046, 197996, 180016, 166535, 123619, 177875, 178144, 98247, 125028, 99008] to [107046, 197996, 180016, 153284, 123619, 177875, 178144, 98247, 125028, 99008].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
