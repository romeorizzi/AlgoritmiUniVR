The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[14, 17]
 - p=[99, 81]
our disinterested advice would be to go second.

The problem solver wants to go second. Ok, I'll take the first move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[99, 81] (keep in mind that d=[14, 17], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [99, 81] to [85, 81].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[85, 81] (keep in mind that d=[14, 17], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   {next_ps}
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[85, 64] (keep in mind that d=[14, 17], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [85, 64] to [71, 64].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[71, 64] (keep in mind that d=[14, 17], to grasp the whole situation).

The problem solver moves from [0, 13] to [0, 0].
