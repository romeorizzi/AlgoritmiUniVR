The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[4, 4]
 - p=[17, 6]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[17, 6] (keep in mind that d=[4, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   [[17, 2], [16, 6]]
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [17, 6] to [17, 2]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[17, 2] (keep in mind that d=[4, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [17, 2] to [13, 2].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[13, 2] (keep in mind that d=[4, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [13, 2] to [12, 2].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[12, 2] (keep in mind that d=[4, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [12, 2] to [8, 2].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[8, 2] (keep in mind that d=[4, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [8, 2] to [7, 2].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[7, 2] (keep in mind that d=[4, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [7, 2] to [3, 2].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[3, 2] (keep in mind that d=[4, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [3, 2] to [2, 2].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[2, 2] (keep in mind that d=[4, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [2, 2] to [0, 2].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 2] (keep in mind that d=[4, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 2] to [0, 0].
