The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=1
 - d=[15]
 - p=[111]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[111] (keep in mind that d=[15], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [111] to [96].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[96] (keep in mind that d=[15], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [96] to [81].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[81] (keep in mind that d=[15], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [81] to [80].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[80] (keep in mind that d=[15], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [80] to [65].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[65] (keep in mind that d=[15], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [65] to [64].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[64] (keep in mind that d=[15], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [64] to [49].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[49] (keep in mind that d=[15], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [49] to [48].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[48] (keep in mind that d=[15], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [48] to [33].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[33] (keep in mind that d=[15], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [33] to [32].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[32] (keep in mind that d=[15], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [32] to [17].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[17] (keep in mind that d=[15], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [17] to [16].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[16] (keep in mind that d=[15], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [16] to [1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[1] (keep in mind that d=[15], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [1] to [0].
