The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[28643, 27898]
 - p=[69115, 29055]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[69115, 29055] (keep in mind that d=[28643, 27898], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   [[58444, 29055], [69115, 11827]]
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [69115, 29055] to [58444, 29055]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:

The server reluctancty moves from [58444, 29055] to [29801, 29055].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
