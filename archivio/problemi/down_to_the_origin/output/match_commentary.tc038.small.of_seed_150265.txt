The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[6, 4, 6, 3, 4, 4, 5, 2, 3, 5]
 - p=[8, 12, 7, 5, 19, 7, 15, 16, 16, 5]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[8, 12, 7, 5, 19, 7, 15, 16, 16, 5] (keep in mind that d=[6, 4, 6, 3, 4, 4, 5, 2, 3, 5], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   [[8, 11, 7, 5, 19, 7, 15, 16, 16, 5], [8, 12, 3, 5, 19, 7, 15, 16, 16, 5], [8, 12, 7, 5, 19, 7, 15, 14, 16, 5], [8, 12, 7, 5, 19, 7, 15, 16, 15, 5], [2, 12, 7, 5, 19, 7, 15, 16, 16, 5], [8, 12, 7, 5, 19, 6, 15, 16, 16, 5], [8, 12, 7, 5, 19, 7, 12, 16, 16, 5], [8, 12, 7, 2, 19, 7, 15, 16, 16, 5]]
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [8, 12, 7, 5, 19, 7, 15, 16, 16, 5] to [8, 11, 7, 5, 19, 7, 15, 16, 16, 5]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
