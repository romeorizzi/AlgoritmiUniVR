The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[19, 13]
 - p=[85, 59]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[85, 59] (keep in mind that d=[19, 13], to grasp the whole situation).
The winning move [83, 59] is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
[[85, 47]] (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [85, 59] to [85, 47].
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [85, 59] to [85, 47]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[85, 47] (keep in mind that d=[19, 13], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [85, 47] to [66, 47].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[66, 47] (keep in mind that d=[19, 13], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [66, 47] to [65, 47].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[65, 47] (keep in mind that d=[19, 13], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [65, 47] to [46, 47].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[46, 47] (keep in mind that d=[19, 13], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [46, 47] to [46, 34].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[46, 34] (keep in mind that d=[19, 13], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [46, 34] to [27, 34].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[27, 34] (keep in mind that d=[19, 13], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [27, 34] to [27, 21].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[27, 21] (keep in mind that d=[19, 13], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [27, 21] to [8, 21].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[8, 21] (keep in mind that d=[19, 13], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [8, 21] to [7, 21].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[7, 21] (keep in mind that d=[19, 13], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [7, 21] to [0, 21].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 21] (keep in mind that d=[19, 13], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 21] to [0, 14].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 14] (keep in mind that d=[19, 13], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 14] to [0, 1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 1] (keep in mind that d=[19, 13], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 1] to [0, 0].
