The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[38574, 23998, 30973, 49586, 37841, 38015, 38408, 42608, 22327, 40613]
 - p=[180869, 165272, 128804, 92022, 155503, 138317, 134970, 153198, 114991, 120243]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:

The winning move [158507, 165272, 128804, 92022, 155503, 138317, 134970, 153198, 114991, 120243] is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
[[180869, 165272, 128804, 92022, 155503, 138317, 134970, 133136, 114991, 120243]] (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [180869, 165272, 128804, 92022, 155503, 138317, 134970, 153198, 114991, 120243] to [180869, 165272, 128804, 92022, 155503, 138317, 134970, 133136, 114991, 120243].
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [180869, 165272, 128804, 92022, 155503, 138317, 134970, 153198, 114991, 120243] to [180869, 165272, 128804, 92022, 155503, 138317, 134970, 133136, 114991, 120243]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
