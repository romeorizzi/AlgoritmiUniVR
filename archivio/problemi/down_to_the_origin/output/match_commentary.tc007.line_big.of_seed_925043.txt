The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=1
 - d=[10000]
 - p=[32966]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[32966] (keep in mind that d=[10000], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [32966] to [30003].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[30003] (keep in mind that d=[10000], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [30003] to [20003].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[20003] (keep in mind that d=[10000], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [20003] to [20002].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[20002] (keep in mind that d=[10000], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [20002] to [10002].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[10002] (keep in mind that d=[10000], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [10002] to [10001].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[10001] (keep in mind that d=[10000], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [10001] to [1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[1] (keep in mind that d=[10000], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [1] to [0].
