The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[9295, 45149]
 - p=[65263, 63314]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[65263, 63314] (keep in mind that d=[9295, 45149], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [65263, 63314] to [65263, 45341].
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [65263, 63314] to [65263, 45341]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[65263, 45341] (keep in mind that d=[9295, 45149], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [65263, 45341] to [55968, 45341].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:

 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   [[55967, 45341], [55968, 192]]
