The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[43560, 45490, 37691, 34361, 33048, 27102, 41044, 24984, 39186, 27912]
 - p=[105636, 130953, 103384, 112887, 172991, 103526, 190729, 143043, 131552, 170846]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[105636, 130953, 103384, 112887, 172991, 103526, 190729, 143043, 131552, 170846] (keep in mind that d=[43560, 45490, 37691, 34361, 33048, 27102, 41044, 24984, 39186, 27912], to grasp the whole situation).
The {winning move =} is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
{next_ps} (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [105636, 130953, 103384, 112887, 172991, 103526, 190729, 143043, 131552, 170846] to [77734, 130953, 103384, 112887, 172991, 103526, 190729, 143043, 131552, 170846].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
