The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[33400, 32321, 44575, 42350, 39582, 42310, 46925, 21581, 26342, 38024]
 - p=[97053, 113025, 94761, 105715, 147091, 106993, 172732, 99064, 95520, 155909]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:

 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   {next_ps}
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
