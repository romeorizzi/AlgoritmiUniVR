The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[9, 9]
 - p=[69, 59]
our disinterested advice would be to go second.

The problem solver wants to go second. Ok, I'll take the first move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[69, 59] (keep in mind that d=[9, 9], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [69, 59] to [60, 59].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[60, 59] (keep in mind that d=[9, 9], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   [[59, 59], [60, 50]]
Move 2: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [60, 59] to [59, 59]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
