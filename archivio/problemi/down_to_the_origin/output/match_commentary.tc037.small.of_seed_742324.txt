The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[6, 5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 4, 6, 5, 3]
 - p=[16, 20, 18, 4, 4, 13, 8, 8, 9, 15]
our disinterested advice would be to go second.

The problem solver wants to go second. Ok, I'll take the first move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[16, 20, 18, 4, 4, 13, 8, 8, 9, 15] (keep in mind that d=[6, 5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 4, 6, 5, 3], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [16, 20, 18, 4, 4, 13, 8, 8, 9, 15] to [10, 20, 18, 4, 4, 13, 8, 8, 9, 15].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[10, 20, 18, 4, 4, 13, 8, 8, 9, 15] (keep in mind that d=[6, 5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 4, 6, 5, 3], to grasp the whole situation).
The {winning move =} is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
{next_ps} (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [10, 20, 18, 4, 4, 13, 8, 8, 9, 15] to [10, 20, 16, 4, 4, 13, 8, 8, 9, 15].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
