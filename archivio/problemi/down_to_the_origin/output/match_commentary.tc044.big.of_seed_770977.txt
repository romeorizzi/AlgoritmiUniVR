The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[32609, 40071, 46736, 47559, 48046, 23566, 43098, 33409, 33460, 28749]
 - p=[151858, 184696, 192306, 146218, 184395, 102655, 194264, 184599, 106001, 116709]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[151858, 184696, 192306, 146218, 184395, 102655, 194264, 184599, 106001, 116709] (keep in mind that d=[32609, 40071, 46736, 47559, 48046, 23566, 43098, 33409, 33460, 28749], to grasp the whole situation).
The winning move [151858, 184696, 192306, 146218, 158400, 102655, 194264, 184599, 106001, 116709] is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
[[151858, 184696, 192306, 137967, 184395, 102655, 194264, 184599, 106001, 116709]] (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [151858, 184696, 192306, 146218, 184395, 102655, 194264, 184599, 106001, 116709] to [151858, 184696, 192306, 137967, 184395, 102655, 194264, 184599, 106001, 116709].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
