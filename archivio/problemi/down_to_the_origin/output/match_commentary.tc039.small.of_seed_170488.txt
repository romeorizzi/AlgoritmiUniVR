The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[4, 2, 2, 4, 2, 2, 2, 6, 4, 4]
 - p=[14, 18, 6, 20, 7, 12, 18, 6, 4, 5]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[14, 18, 6, 20, 7, 12, 18, 6, 4, 5] (keep in mind that d=[4, 2, 2, 4, 2, 2, 2, 6, 4, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:

Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [14, 18, 6, 20, 7, 12, 18, 6, 4, 5] to [14, 18, 6, 20, 7, 12, 18, 1, 4, 5]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
