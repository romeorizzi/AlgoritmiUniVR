The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[10, 13]
 - p=[70, 89]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[70, 89] (keep in mind that d=[10, 13], to grasp the whole situation).
The winning move [70, 88] is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
[[60, 89]] (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [70, 89] to [60, 89].
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [70, 89] to [60, 89]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[60, 89] (keep in mind that d=[10, 13], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [60, 89] to [50, 89].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[50, 89] (keep in mind that d=[10, 13], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [50, 89] to [49, 89].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[49, 89] (keep in mind that d=[10, 13], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [49, 89] to [39, 89].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:

The problem solver moves from [39, 89] to [39, 76].

The problem solver moves from [0, 50] to [0, 42].
# The server is now facing the position:

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 1] (keep in mind that d=[10, 13], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 1] to [0, 0].
