The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[37, 34, 31, 31, 30, 35, 33, 29, 37, 37]
 - p=[114, 118, 116, 173, 206, 265, 279, 269, 146, 112]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[114, 118, 116, 173, 206, 265, 279, 269, 146, 112] (keep in mind that d=[37, 34, 31, 31, 30, 35, 33, 29, 37, 37], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   {next_ps}
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
