The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[5, 4]
 - p=[5, 16]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[5, 16] (keep in mind that d=[5, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [5, 16] to [1, 16].
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [5, 16] to [1, 16]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[1, 16] (keep in mind that d=[5, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [1, 16] to [0, 16].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 16] (keep in mind that d=[5, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 16] to [0, 15].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 15] (keep in mind that d=[5, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 15] to [0, 11].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 11] (keep in mind that d=[5, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 11] to [0, 10].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 10] (keep in mind that d=[5, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 10] to [0, 6].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 6] (keep in mind that d=[5, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 6] to [0, 5].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 5] (keep in mind that d=[5, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 5] to [0, 1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 1] (keep in mind that d=[5, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 1] to [0, 0].
