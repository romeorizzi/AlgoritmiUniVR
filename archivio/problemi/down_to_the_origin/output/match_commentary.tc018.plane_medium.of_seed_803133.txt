The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[19, 12]
 - p=[60, 87]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[60, 87] (keep in mind that d=[19, 12], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   [[49, 87], [60, 78]]
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [60, 87] to [49, 87]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[49, 87] (keep in mind that d=[19, 12], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [49, 87] to [30, 87].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[30, 87] (keep in mind that d=[19, 12], to grasp the whole situation).

# p=[30, 75] (keep in mind that d=[19, 12], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [30, 75] to [11, 75].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[11, 75] (keep in mind that d=[19, 12], to grasp the whole situation).

The problem solver moves from [0, 14] to [0, 13].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 13] (keep in mind that d=[19, 12], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 13] to [0, 1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 1] (keep in mind that d=[19, 12], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 1] to [0, 0].
