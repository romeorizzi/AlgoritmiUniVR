The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=1
 - d=[20]
 - p=[117]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[117] (keep in mind that d=[20], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [117] to [105].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[105] (keep in mind that d=[20], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [105] to [85].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[85] (keep in mind that d=[20], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [85] to [84].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[84] (keep in mind that d=[20], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [84] to [64].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[64] (keep in mind that d=[20], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [64] to [63].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[63] (keep in mind that d=[20], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [63] to [43].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[43] (keep in mind that d=[20], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [43] to [42].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[42] (keep in mind that d=[20], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [42] to [22].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[22] (keep in mind that d=[20], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [22] to [21].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[21] (keep in mind that d=[20], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [21] to [1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[1] (keep in mind that d=[20], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [1] to [0].
