The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[34, 32, 26, 29, 37, 30, 25, 37, 33, 27]
 - p=[268, 292, 193, 248, 185, 164, 261, 115, 214, 246]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[268, 292, 193, 248, 185, 164, 261, 115, 214, 246] (keep in mind that d=[34, 32, 26, 29, 37, 30, 25, 37, 33, 27], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [268, 292, 193, 248, 185, 164, 261, 115, 214, 246] to [268, 292, 193, 248, 170, 164, 261, 115, 214, 246].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

The {winning move =} is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
{next_ps} (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
