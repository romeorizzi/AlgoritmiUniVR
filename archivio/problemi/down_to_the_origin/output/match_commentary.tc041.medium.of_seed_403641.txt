The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[25, 25, 24, 31, 21, 32, 27, 30, 37, 32]
 - p=[175, 165, 206, 196, 202, 110, 225, 244, 127, 141]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[175, 165, 206, 196, 202, 110, 225, 244, 127, 141] (keep in mind that d=[25, 25, 24, 31, 21, 32, 27, 30, 37, 32], to grasp the whole situation).
The {winning move =} is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
{next_ps} (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [175, 165, 206, 196, 202, 110, 225, 244, 127, 141] to [175, 165, 206, 196, 202, 101, 225, 244, 127, 141].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
