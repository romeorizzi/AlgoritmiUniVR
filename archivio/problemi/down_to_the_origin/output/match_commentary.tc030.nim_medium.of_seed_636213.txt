The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[26, 29, 17, 26, 23, 20, 15, 19, 25, 20]
 - p=[196, 174, 101, 169, 180, 245, 289, 160, 265, 152]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[196, 174, 101, 169, 180, 245, 289, 160, 265, 152] (keep in mind that d=[26, 29, 17, 26, 23, 20, 15, 19, 25, 20], to grasp the whole situation).
The winning move [185, 174, 101, 169, 180, 245, 289, 160, 265, 152] is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
[[196, 174, 101, 169, 180, 245, 289, 156, 265, 152]] (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [196, 174, 101, 169, 180, 245, 289, 160, 265, 152] to [196, 174, 101, 169, 180, 245, 289, 156, 265, 152].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
