The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[23, 36, 31, 36, 37, 30, 35, 36, 34, 33]
 - p=[178, 131, 177, 115, 179, 283, 172, 282, 215, 207]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[178, 131, 177, 115, 179, 283, 172, 282, 215, 207] (keep in mind that d=[23, 36, 31, 36, 37, 30, 35, 36, 34, 33], to grasp the whole situation).
The {winning move =} is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
{next_ps} (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [178, 131, 177, 115, 179, 283, 172, 282, 215, 207] to [178, 131, 177, 115, 179, 283, 172, 273, 215, 207].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
