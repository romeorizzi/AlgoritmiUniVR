The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[2, 2]
 - p=[19, 17]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[19, 17] (keep in mind that d=[2, 2], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   {next_ps}
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
