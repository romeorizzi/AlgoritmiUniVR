The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[31932, 44881]
 - p=[47513, 97924]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[47513, 97924] (keep in mind that d=[31932, 44881], to grasp the whole situation).
The {winning move =} is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
{next_ps} (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [47513, 97924] to [40093, 97924].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[40093, 97924] (keep in mind that d=[31932, 44881], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [40093, 97924] to [8161, 97924].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[8161, 97924] (keep in mind that d=[31932, 44881], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [8161, 97924] to [8161, 53043].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[8161, 53043] (keep in mind that d=[31932, 44881], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [8161, 53043] to [0, 53043].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 53043] (keep in mind that d=[31932, 44881], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 53043] to [0, 44882].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 44882] (keep in mind that d=[31932, 44881], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 44882] to [0, 1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 1] (keep in mind that d=[31932, 44881], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 1] to [0, 0].
