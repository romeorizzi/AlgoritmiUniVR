The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[3, 5]
 - p=[8, 20]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[8, 20] (keep in mind that d=[3, 5], to grasp the whole situation).
The winning move [8, 18] is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
[[6, 20]] (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [8, 20] to [6, 20].
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [8, 20] to [6, 20]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[6, 20] (keep in mind that d=[3, 5], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [6, 20] to [3, 20].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[3, 20] (keep in mind that d=[3, 5], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [3, 20] to [3, 15].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[3, 15] (keep in mind that d=[3, 5], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [3, 15] to [0, 15].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 15] (keep in mind that d=[3, 5], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 15] to [0, 12].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 12] (keep in mind that d=[3, 5], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 12] to [0, 7].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 7] (keep in mind that d=[3, 5], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 7] to [0, 6].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 6] (keep in mind that d=[3, 5], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 6] to [0, 1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 1] (keep in mind that d=[3, 5], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 1] to [0, 0].
