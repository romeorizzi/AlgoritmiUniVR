The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[17, 15]
 - p=[59, 80]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[59, 80] (keep in mind that d=[17, 15], to grasp the whole situation).
The winning move [59, 69] is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
[[54, 80]] (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [59, 80] to [54, 80].
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [59, 80] to [54, 80]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[54, 80] (keep in mind that d=[17, 15], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [54, 80] to [37, 80].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[37, 80] (keep in mind that d=[17, 15], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [37, 80] to [36, 80].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[36, 80] (keep in mind that d=[17, 15], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [36, 80] to [19, 80].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[19, 80] (keep in mind that d=[17, 15], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [19, 80] to [18, 80].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[18, 80] (keep in mind that d=[17, 15], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [18, 80] to [1, 80].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[1, 80] (keep in mind that d=[17, 15], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [1, 80] to [0, 80].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 80] (keep in mind that d=[17, 15], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 80] to [0, 65].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 65] (keep in mind that d=[17, 15], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 65] to [0, 64].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 64] (keep in mind that d=[17, 15], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 64] to [0, 49].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 49] (keep in mind that d=[17, 15], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 49] to [0, 48].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 48] (keep in mind that d=[17, 15], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 48] to [0, 33].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 33] (keep in mind that d=[17, 15], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 33] to [0, 32].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 32] (keep in mind that d=[17, 15], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 32] to [0, 17].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 17] (keep in mind that d=[17, 15], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 17] to [0, 16].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 16] (keep in mind that d=[17, 15], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 16] to [0, 1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 1] (keep in mind that d=[17, 15], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 1] to [0, 0].
