The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[2, 4, 2, 4, 6, 6, 5, 6, 6, 2]
 - p=[18, 13, 11, 12, 14, 4, 12, 6, 11, 15]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[18, 13, 11, 12, 14, 4, 12, 6, 11, 15] (keep in mind that d=[2, 4, 2, 4, 6, 6, 5, 6, 6, 2], to grasp the whole situation).
The winning move [18, 13, 11, 12, 12, 4, 12, 6, 11, 15] is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
[[18, 13, 11, 12, 14, 4, 11, 6, 11, 15]] (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [18, 13, 11, 12, 14, 4, 12, 6, 11, 15] to [18, 13, 11, 12, 14, 4, 11, 6, 11, 15].
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [18, 13, 11, 12, 14, 4, 12, 6, 11, 15] to [18, 13, 11, 12, 14, 4, 11, 6, 11, 15]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
