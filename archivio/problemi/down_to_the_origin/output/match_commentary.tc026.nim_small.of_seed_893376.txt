The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[4, 3, 5, 4, 5, 2, 3, 2, 6, 4]
 - p=[11, 9, 16, 5, 18, 8, 20, 6, 17, 19]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[11, 9, 16, 5, 18, 8, 20, 6, 17, 19] (keep in mind that d=[4, 3, 5, 4, 5, 2, 3, 2, 6, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The winning move [10, 9, 16, 5, 18, 8, 20, 6, 17, 19] is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
[[11, 9, 16, 5, 13, 8, 20, 6, 17, 19]] (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [11, 9, 16, 5, 18, 8, 20, 6, 17, 19] to [11, 9, 16, 5, 13, 8, 20, 6, 17, 19].
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [11, 9, 16, 5, 18, 8, 20, 6, 17, 19] to [11, 9, 16, 5, 13, 8, 20, 6, 17, 19]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
