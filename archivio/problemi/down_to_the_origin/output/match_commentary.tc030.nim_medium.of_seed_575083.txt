The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[27, 17, 15, 15, 27, 15, 15, 21, 16, 13]
 - p=[292, 230, 106, 113, 204, 101, 245, 265, 245, 155]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
