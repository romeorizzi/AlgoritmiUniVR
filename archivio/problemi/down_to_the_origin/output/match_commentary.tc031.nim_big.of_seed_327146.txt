The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[26267, 36970, 38020, 35581, 32610, 30697, 49857, 37238, 23418, 45492]
 - p=[106518, 121456, 192782, 177755, 145838, 191205, 142591, 141230, 111471, 188567]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:

The winning move [80340, 121456, 192782, 177755, 145838, 191205, 142591, 141230, 111471, 188567] is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
[[106518, 121456, 192782, 177755, 145838, 191205, 142591, 140628, 111471, 188567]] (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [106518, 121456, 192782, 177755, 145838, 191205, 142591, 141230, 111471, 188567] to [106518, 121456, 192782, 177755, 145838, 191205, 142591, 140628, 111471, 188567].
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [106518, 121456, 192782, 177755, 145838, 191205, 142591, 141230, 111471, 188567] to [106518, 121456, 192782, 177755, 145838, 191205, 142591, 140628, 111471, 188567]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
