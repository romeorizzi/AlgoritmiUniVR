The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[27, 26, 24, 24, 17, 24, 28, 27, 23, 20]
 - p=[108, 155, 219, 283, 146, 267, 256, 292, 202, 148]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[108, 155, 219, 283, 146, 267, 256, 292, 202, 148] (keep in mind that d=[27, 26, 24, 24, 17, 24, 28, 27, 23, 20], to grasp the whole situation).
The {winning move =} is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
{next_ps} (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [108, 155, 219, 283, 146, 267, 256, 292, 202, 148] to [108, 155, 219, 283, 146, 267, 256, 292, 185, 148].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
