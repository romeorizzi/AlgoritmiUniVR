The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[14, 11]
 - p=[98, 59]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[98, 59] (keep in mind that d=[14, 11], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   [[86, 59], [98, 56]]
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [98, 59] to [86, 59]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[86, 59] (keep in mind that d=[14, 11], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [86, 59] to [72, 59].
