The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=1
 - d=[10022]
 - p=[44035]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[44035] (keep in mind that d=[10022], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [44035] to [40092].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[40092] (keep in mind that d=[10022], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [40092] to [30070].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[30070] (keep in mind that d=[10022], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [30070] to [30069].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[30069] (keep in mind that d=[10022], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [30069] to [20047].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[20047] (keep in mind that d=[10022], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [20047] to [20046].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[20046] (keep in mind that d=[10022], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [20046] to [10024].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[10024] (keep in mind that d=[10022], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [10024] to [10023].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[10023] (keep in mind that d=[10022], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [10023] to [1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[1] (keep in mind that d=[10022], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [1] to [0].
