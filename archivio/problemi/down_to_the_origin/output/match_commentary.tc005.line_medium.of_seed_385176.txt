The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=1
 - d=[18]
 - p=[243]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[243] (keep in mind that d=[18], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [243] to [228].
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [243] to [228]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
