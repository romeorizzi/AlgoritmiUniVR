The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[3, 6, 5, 5, 3, 3, 6, 5, 4, 3]
 - p=[13, 16, 12, 8, 15, 14, 15, 8, 13, 18]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[13, 16, 12, 8, 15, 14, 15, 8, 13, 18] (keep in mind that d=[3, 6, 5, 5, 3, 3, 6, 5, 4, 3], to grasp the whole situation).
The winning move [11, 16, 12, 8, 15, 14, 15, 8, 13, 18] is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
[[13, 16, 12, 8, 13, 14, 15, 8, 13, 18]] (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [13, 16, 12, 8, 15, 14, 15, 8, 13, 18] to [13, 16, 12, 8, 13, 14, 15, 8, 13, 18].
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [13, 16, 12, 8, 15, 14, 15, 8, 13, 18] to [13, 16, 12, 8, 13, 14, 15, 8, 13, 18]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
