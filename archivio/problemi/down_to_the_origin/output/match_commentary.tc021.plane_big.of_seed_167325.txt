The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[49736, 14146]
 - p=[15670, 58667]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[15670, 58667] (keep in mind that d=[49736, 14146], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [15670, 58667] to [2079, 58667].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[2079, 58667] (keep in mind that d=[49736, 14146], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [2079, 58667] to [0, 58667].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 58667] (keep in mind that d=[49736, 14146], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 58667] to [0, 56588].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 56588] (keep in mind that d=[49736, 14146], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 56588] to [0, 42442].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 42442] (keep in mind that d=[49736, 14146], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 42442] to [0, 42441].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 42441] (keep in mind that d=[49736, 14146], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 42441] to [0, 28295].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 28295] (keep in mind that d=[49736, 14146], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 28295] to [0, 28294].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 28294] (keep in mind that d=[49736, 14146], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 28294] to [0, 14148].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 14148] (keep in mind that d=[49736, 14146], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 14148] to [0, 14147].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 14147] (keep in mind that d=[49736, 14146], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 14147] to [0, 1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 1] (keep in mind that d=[49736, 14146], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 1] to [0, 0].
