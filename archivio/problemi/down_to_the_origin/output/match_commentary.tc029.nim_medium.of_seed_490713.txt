The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[23, 27, 27, 24, 16, 25, 28, 14, 19, 15]
 - p=[216, 253, 261, 276, 245, 123, 181, 134, 227, 104]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[216, 253, 261, 276, 245, 123, 181, 134, 227, 104] (keep in mind that d=[23, 27, 27, 24, 16, 25, 28, 14, 19, 15], to grasp the whole situation).
The winning move [216, 250, 261, 276, 245, 123, 181, 134, 227, 104] is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
[[216, 253, 261, 276, 245, 123, 173, 134, 227, 104]] (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [216, 253, 261, 276, 245, 123, 181, 134, 227, 104] to [216, 253, 261, 276, 245, 123, 173, 134, 227, 104].
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [216, 253, 261, 276, 245, 123, 181, 134, 227, 104] to [216, 253, 261, 276, 245, 123, 173, 134, 227, 104]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
