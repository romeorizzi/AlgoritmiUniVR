The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[33, 26, 36, 32, 25, 36, 35, 27, 23, 30]
 - p=[186, 123, 155, 288, 209, 270, 281, 280, 152, 183]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[186, 123, 155, 288, 209, 270, 281, 280, 152, 183] (keep in mind that d=[33, 26, 36, 32, 25, 36, 35, 27, 23, 30], to grasp the whole situation).
The winning move [155, 123, 155, 288, 209, 270, 281, 280, 152, 183] is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
[[186, 123, 152, 288, 209, 270, 281, 280, 152, 183]] (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [186, 123, 155, 288, 209, 270, 281, 280, 152, 183] to [186, 123, 152, 288, 209, 270, 281, 280, 152, 183].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
