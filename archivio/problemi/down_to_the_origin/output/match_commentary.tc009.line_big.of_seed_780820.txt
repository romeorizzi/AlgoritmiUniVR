The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=1
 - d=[10976]
 - p=[59869]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[59869] (keep in mind that d=[10976], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [59869] to [54885].
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [59869] to [54885]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[54885] (keep in mind that d=[10976], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [54885] to [43909].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[43909] (keep in mind that d=[10976], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [43909] to [43908].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[43908] (keep in mind that d=[10976], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [43908] to [32932].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[32932] (keep in mind that d=[10976], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [32932] to [32931].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[32931] (keep in mind that d=[10976], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [32931] to [21955].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[21955] (keep in mind that d=[10976], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [21955] to [21954].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[21954] (keep in mind that d=[10976], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [21954] to [10978].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[10978] (keep in mind that d=[10976], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [10978] to [10977].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[10977] (keep in mind that d=[10976], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [10977] to [1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[1] (keep in mind that d=[10976], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [1] to [0].
