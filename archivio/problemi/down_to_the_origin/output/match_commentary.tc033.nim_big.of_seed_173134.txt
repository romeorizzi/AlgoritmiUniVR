The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[31011, 44287, 23598, 46711, 40503, 32263, 40273, 44930, 25861, 21818]
 - p=[169105, 120330, 185229, 168249, 144670, 103634, 159843, 190099, 132159, 98907]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:

 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   {next_ps}
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
