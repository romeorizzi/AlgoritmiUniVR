The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[18, 9]
 - p=[50, 81]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[50, 81] (keep in mind that d=[18, 9], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [50, 81] to [39, 81].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[39, 81] (keep in mind that d=[18, 9], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [39, 81] to [21, 81].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[21, 81] (keep in mind that d=[18, 9], to grasp the whole situation).
The {winning move =} is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
{next_ps} (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [21, 81] to [21, 72].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[21, 72] (keep in mind that d=[18, 9], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [21, 72] to [3, 72].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[3, 72] (keep in mind that d=[18, 9], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [3, 72] to [3, 63].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[3, 63] (keep in mind that d=[18, 9], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [3, 63] to [0, 63].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 63] (keep in mind that d=[18, 9], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 63] to [0, 60].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 60] (keep in mind that d=[18, 9], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 60] to [0, 51].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 51] (keep in mind that d=[18, 9], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 51] to [0, 50].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 50] (keep in mind that d=[18, 9], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 50] to [0, 41].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 41] (keep in mind that d=[18, 9], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 41] to [0, 40].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 40] (keep in mind that d=[18, 9], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 40] to [0, 31].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 31] (keep in mind that d=[18, 9], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 31] to [0, 30].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 30] (keep in mind that d=[18, 9], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 30] to [0, 21].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 21] (keep in mind that d=[18, 9], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 21] to [0, 20].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 20] (keep in mind that d=[18, 9], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 20] to [0, 11].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 11] (keep in mind that d=[18, 9], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 11] to [0, 10].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 10] (keep in mind that d=[18, 9], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 10] to [0, 1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 1] (keep in mind that d=[18, 9], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 1] to [0, 0].
