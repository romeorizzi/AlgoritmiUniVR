The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[4041998, 3346017]
 - p=[19320150, 64785971]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[19320150, 64785971] (keep in mind that d=[4041998, 3346017], to grasp the whole situation).
The winning move [19320150, 63380478] is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
[[17379625, 64785971]] (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [19320150, 64785971] to [17379625, 64785971].
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [19320150, 64785971] to [17379625, 64785971]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
