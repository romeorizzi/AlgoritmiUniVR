The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 6, 3, 5, 3, 6]
 - p=[20, 10, 8, 18, 10, 14, 18, 8, 13, 19]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[20, 10, 8, 18, 10, 14, 18, 8, 13, 19] (keep in mind that d=[3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 6, 3, 5, 3, 6], to grasp the whole situation).
The winning move [20, 10, 8, 18, 10, 12, 18, 8, 13, 19] is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
[[20, 10, 8, 18, 10, 14, 18, 8, 13, 14]] (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [20, 10, 8, 18, 10, 14, 18, 8, 13, 19] to [20, 10, 8, 18, 10, 14, 18, 8, 13, 14].
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [20, 10, 8, 18, 10, 14, 18, 8, 13, 19] to [20, 10, 8, 18, 10, 14, 18, 8, 13, 14]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
