The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[5, 4, 4, 3, 4, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]
 - p=[16, 19, 14, 9, 19, 7, 7, 10, 15, 13]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:

Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
