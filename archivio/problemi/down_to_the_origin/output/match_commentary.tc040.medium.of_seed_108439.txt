The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[34, 27, 31, 27, 25, 25, 26, 30, 25, 28]
 - p=[176, 274, 179, 249, 135, 205, 198, 245, 133, 167]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[176, 274, 179, 249, 135, 205, 198, 245, 133, 167] (keep in mind that d=[34, 27, 31, 27, 25, 25, 26, 30, 25, 28], to grasp the whole situation).

Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
