The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[2, 4, 5, 5, 4, 4, 2, 4, 4, 3]
 - p=[15, 8, 14, 18, 19, 16, 5, 7, 16, 12]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[15, 8, 14, 18, 19, 16, 5, 7, 16, 12] (keep in mind that d=[2, 4, 5, 5, 4, 4, 2, 4, 4, 3], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   [[15, 8, 14, 18, 16, 16, 5, 7, 16, 12], [15, 8, 14, 17, 19, 16, 5, 7, 16, 12], [15, 8, 14, 18, 19, 16, 5, 7, 14, 12], [15, 8, 14, 18, 19, 14, 5, 7, 16, 12]]
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [15, 8, 14, 18, 19, 16, 5, 7, 16, 12] to [15, 8, 14, 18, 16, 16, 5, 7, 16, 12]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
