The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=1
 - d=[21]
 - p=[240]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[240] (keep in mind that d=[21], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [240] to [220].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[220] (keep in mind that d=[21], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [220] to [199].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[199] (keep in mind that d=[21], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [199] to [198].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[198] (keep in mind that d=[21], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [198] to [177].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[177] (keep in mind that d=[21], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [177] to [176].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[176] (keep in mind that d=[21], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [176] to [155].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[155] (keep in mind that d=[21], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [155] to [154].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[154] (keep in mind that d=[21], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [154] to [133].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[133] (keep in mind that d=[21], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [133] to [132].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[132] (keep in mind that d=[21], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [132] to [111].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[111] (keep in mind that d=[21], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [111] to [110].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[110] (keep in mind that d=[21], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [110] to [89].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[89] (keep in mind that d=[21], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [89] to [88].
# The server is now facing the position:

The problem solver moves from [67] to [66].
# The server is now facing the position:

The server reluctancty moves from [66] to [45].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[45] (keep in mind that d=[21], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [45] to [44].
# The server is now facing the position:

The server reluctancty moves from [44] to [23].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:

The problem solver moves from [23] to [22].
# The server is now facing the position:
