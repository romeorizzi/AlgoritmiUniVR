The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[20, 16, 23, 22, 14, 23, 18, 15, 12, 20]
 - p=[235, 222, 110, 280, 179, 112, 133, 138, 264, 293]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[235, 222, 110, 280, 179, 112, 133, 138, 264, 293] (keep in mind that d=[20, 16, 23, 22, 14, 23, 18, 15, 12, 20], to grasp the whole situation).

Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
