The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[31, 24, 27, 35, 24, 25, 23, 35, 22, 37]
 - p=[294, 153, 124, 243, 284, 255, 261, 218, 267, 147]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[294, 153, 124, 243, 284, 255, 261, 218, 267, 147] (keep in mind that d=[31, 24, 27, 35, 24, 25, 23, 35, 22, 37], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [294, 153, 124, 243, 284, 255, 261, 218, 267, 147] to [294, 153, 124, 243, 284, 255, 261, 218, 267, 137].
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [294, 153, 124, 243, 284, 255, 261, 218, 267, 147] to [294, 153, 124, 243, 284, 255, 261, 218, 267, 137]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
