The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[3, 4]
 - p=[19, 20]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[19, 20] (keep in mind that d=[3, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   [[16, 20], [19, 18]]
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [19, 20] to [16, 20]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[16, 20] (keep in mind that d=[3, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [16, 20] to [13, 20].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[13, 20] (keep in mind that d=[3, 4], to grasp the whole situation).

The server reluctancty moves from [13, 16] to [10, 16].

# p=[0, 1] (keep in mind that d=[3, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 1] to [0, 0].
