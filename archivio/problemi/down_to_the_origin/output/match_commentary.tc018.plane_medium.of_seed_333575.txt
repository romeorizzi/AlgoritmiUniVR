The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[10, 17]
 - p=[94, 72]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[94, 72] (keep in mind that d=[10, 17], to grasp the whole situation).
The winning move [94, 60] is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
[[88, 72]] (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [94, 72] to [88, 72].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
