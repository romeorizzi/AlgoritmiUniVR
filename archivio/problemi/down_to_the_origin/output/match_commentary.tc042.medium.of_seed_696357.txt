The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[29, 35, 37, 33, 36, 31, 24, 33, 30, 33]
 - p=[169, 271, 131, 146, 122, 211, 295, 216, 183, 199]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.
