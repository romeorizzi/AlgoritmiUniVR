The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[24, 24, 23, 27, 22, 28, 34, 21, 22, 35]
 - p=[275, 242, 208, 184, 287, 148, 247, 114, 148, 137]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
