The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[19512, 42255]
 - p=[61865, 66533]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[61865, 66533] (keep in mind that d=[19512, 42255], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [61865, 66533] to [61865, 45582].
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [61865, 66533] to [61865, 45582]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[61865, 45582] (keep in mind that d=[19512, 42255], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [61865, 45582] to [42353, 45582].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[42353, 45582] (keep in mind that d=[19512, 42255], to grasp the whole situation).
The winning move [42353, 3327] is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
[[42352, 45582]] (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
