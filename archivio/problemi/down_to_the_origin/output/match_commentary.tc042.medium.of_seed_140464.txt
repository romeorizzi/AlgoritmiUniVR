The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[37, 29, 30, 35, 25, 30, 31, 36, 29, 26]
 - p=[281, 251, 269, 222, 228, 260, 132, 184, 288, 218]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[281, 251, 269, 222, 228, 260, 132, 184, 288, 218] (keep in mind that d=[37, 29, 30, 35, 25, 30, 31, 36, 29, 26], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [281, 251, 269, 222, 228, 260, 132, 184, 288, 218] to [281, 251, 269, 222, 228, 260, 132, 175, 288, 218].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

The {winning move =} is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
{next_ps} (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
