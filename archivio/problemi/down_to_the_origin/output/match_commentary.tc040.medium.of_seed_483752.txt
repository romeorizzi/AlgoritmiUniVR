The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[23, 36, 29, 25, 25, 21, 29, 37, 24, 30]
 - p=[170, 132, 103, 269, 240, 178, 214, 139, 252, 115]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:

Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
