The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[25671, 40221]
 - p=[63049, 97092]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[63049, 97092] (keep in mind that d=[25671, 40221], to grasp the whole situation).
The winning move [42320, 97092] is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
[[63049, 92149]] (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [63049, 97092] to [63049, 92149].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[63049, 92149] (keep in mind that d=[25671, 40221], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [63049, 92149] to [37378, 92149].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:

The problem solver moves from [11706, 92149] to [11706, 51928].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[11706, 51928] (keep in mind that d=[25671, 40221], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [11706, 51928] to [0, 51928].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 51928] (keep in mind that d=[25671, 40221], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 51928] to [0, 40222].
