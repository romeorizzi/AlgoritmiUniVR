The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[4377322, 3928748]
 - p=[94275832, 44388726]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[94275832, 44388726] (keep in mind that d=[4377322, 3928748], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
