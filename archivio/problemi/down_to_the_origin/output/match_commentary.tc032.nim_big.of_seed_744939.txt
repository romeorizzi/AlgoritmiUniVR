The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[34265, 37777, 28393, 35260, 45727, 24763, 24628, 38092, 42577, 27042]
 - p=[112132, 151793, 114593, 94698, 123112, 135684, 116838, 196473, 194382, 134795]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:

 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   {next_ps}
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
