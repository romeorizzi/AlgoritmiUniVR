The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[2, 4]
 - p=[10, 11]
our disinterested advice would be to go second.

The problem solver wants to go second. Ok, I'll take the first move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[10, 11] (keep in mind that d=[2, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [10, 11] to [8, 11].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[8, 11] (keep in mind that d=[2, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   {next_ps}
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[7, 11] (keep in mind that d=[2, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [7, 11] to [5, 11].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[5, 11] (keep in mind that d=[2, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   {next_ps}
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[4, 11] (keep in mind that d=[2, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [4, 11] to [2, 11].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[2, 11] (keep in mind that d=[2, 4], to grasp the whole situation).

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[1, 11] (keep in mind that d=[2, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [1, 11] to [0, 11].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 11] (keep in mind that d=[2, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 11] to [0, 10].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 10] (keep in mind that d=[2, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 10] to [0, 6].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 6] (keep in mind that d=[2, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 6] to [0, 5].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 5] (keep in mind that d=[2, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 5] to [0, 1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 1] (keep in mind that d=[2, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 1] to [0, 0].
