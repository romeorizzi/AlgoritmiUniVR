The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[5, 5]
 - p=[6, 6]
our disinterested advice would be to go second.

The problem solver wants to go second. Ok, I'll take the first move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[6, 6] (keep in mind that d=[5, 5], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [6, 6] to [1, 6].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[1, 6] (keep in mind that d=[5, 5], to grasp the whole situation).
The winning move [0, 6] is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
[[1, 1]] (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [1, 6] to [1, 1].
Move 2: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [1, 6] to [1, 1]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[1, 1] (keep in mind that d=[5, 5], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [1, 1] to [0, 1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 1] (keep in mind that d=[5, 5], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 1] to [0, 0].
