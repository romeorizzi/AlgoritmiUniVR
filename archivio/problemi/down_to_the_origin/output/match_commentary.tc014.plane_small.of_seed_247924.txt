The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[6, 6]
 - p=[20, 4]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[20, 4] (keep in mind that d=[6, 6], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [20, 4] to [18, 4].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[18, 4] (keep in mind that d=[6, 6], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [18, 4] to [12, 4].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[12, 4] (keep in mind that d=[6, 6], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [12, 4] to [11, 4].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[11, 4] (keep in mind that d=[6, 6], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [11, 4] to [5, 4].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[5, 4] (keep in mind that d=[6, 6], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [5, 4] to [4, 4].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[4, 4] (keep in mind that d=[6, 6], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [4, 4] to [0, 4].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 4] (keep in mind that d=[6, 6], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 4] to [0, 0].
