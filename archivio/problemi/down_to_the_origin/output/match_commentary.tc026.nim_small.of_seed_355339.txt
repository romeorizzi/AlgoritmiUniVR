The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[4, 3, 5, 5, 5, 6, 2, 2, 2, 3]
 - p=[13, 8, 5, 13, 13, 14, 16, 19, 4, 4]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[13, 8, 5, 13, 13, 14, 16, 19, 4, 4] (keep in mind that d=[4, 3, 5, 5, 5, 6, 2, 2, 2, 3], to grasp the whole situation).
The {winning move =} is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
{next_ps} (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [13, 8, 5, 13, 13, 14, 16, 19, 4, 4] to [9, 8, 5, 13, 13, 14, 16, 19, 4, 4].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
