The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=1
 - d=[29]
 - p=[139]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[139] (keep in mind that d=[29], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [139] to [120].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[120] (keep in mind that d=[29], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [120] to [91].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[91] (keep in mind that d=[29], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [91] to [90].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[90] (keep in mind that d=[29], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [90] to [61].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[61] (keep in mind that d=[29], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [61] to [60].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[60] (keep in mind that d=[29], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [60] to [31].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[31] (keep in mind that d=[29], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [31] to [30].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[30] (keep in mind that d=[29], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [30] to [1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[1] (keep in mind that d=[29], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [1] to [0].
