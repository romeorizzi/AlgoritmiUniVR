The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[5, 2]
 - p=[13, 12]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[13, 12] (keep in mind that d=[5, 2], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   [[13, 10], [12, 12]]
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [13, 12] to [13, 10]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[13, 10] (keep in mind that d=[5, 2], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [13, 10] to [8, 10].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[8, 10] (keep in mind that d=[5, 2], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   [[7, 10], [8, 8]]
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[7, 10] (keep in mind that d=[5, 2], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [7, 10] to [2, 10].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[2, 10] (keep in mind that d=[5, 2], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   [[1, 10], [2, 8]]
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[1, 10] (keep in mind that d=[5, 2], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [1, 10] to [0, 10].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 10] (keep in mind that d=[5, 2], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 10] to [0, 9].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 9] (keep in mind that d=[5, 2], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 9] to [0, 7].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 7] (keep in mind that d=[5, 2], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 7] to [0, 6].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 6] (keep in mind that d=[5, 2], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 6] to [0, 4].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 4] (keep in mind that d=[5, 2], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 4] to [0, 3].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 3] (keep in mind that d=[5, 2], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 3] to [0, 1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 1] (keep in mind that d=[5, 2], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 1] to [0, 0].
