The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=1
 - d=[8131]
 - p=[44355]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[44355] (keep in mind that d=[8131], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [44355] to [40660].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[40660] (keep in mind that d=[8131], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [40660] to [32529].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[32529] (keep in mind that d=[8131], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [32529] to [32528].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[32528] (keep in mind that d=[8131], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [32528] to [24397].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[24397] (keep in mind that d=[8131], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [24397] to [24396].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[24396] (keep in mind that d=[8131], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [24396] to [16265].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[16265] (keep in mind that d=[8131], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [16265] to [16264].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[16264] (keep in mind that d=[8131], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [16264] to [8133].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[8133] (keep in mind that d=[8131], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [8133] to [8132].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[8132] (keep in mind that d=[8131], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [8132] to [1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[1] (keep in mind that d=[8131], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [1] to [0].
