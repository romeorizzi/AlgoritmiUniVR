The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[33520, 25426, 24784, 39895, 29551, 49610, 32032, 50442, 27772, 44764]
 - p=[116111, 117661, 180541, 192716, 197120, 153795, 197570, 95120, 130137, 195356]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:

 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   {next_ps}
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
