The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[24, 17, 29, 19, 22, 17, 27, 22, 19, 22]
 - p=[199, 219, 187, 265, 122, 115, 215, 114, 183, 225]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[199, 219, 187, 265, 122, 115, 215, 114, 183, 225] (keep in mind that d=[24, 17, 29, 19, 22, 17, 27, 22, 19, 22], to grasp the whole situation).
The winning move [196, 219, 187, 265, 122, 115, 215, 114, 183, 225] is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
[[199, 219, 187, 265, 122, 115, 215, 114, 174, 225]] (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [199, 219, 187, 265, 122, 115, 215, 114, 183, 225] to [199, 219, 187, 265, 122, 115, 215, 114, 174, 225].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
