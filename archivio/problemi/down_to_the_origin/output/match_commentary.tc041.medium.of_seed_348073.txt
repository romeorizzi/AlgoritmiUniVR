The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[27, 25, 36, 32, 30, 36, 24, 36, 25, 35]
 - p=[202, 274, 144, 220, 162, 160, 272, 224, 255, 181]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[202, 274, 144, 220, 162, 160, 272, 224, 255, 181] (keep in mind that d=[27, 25, 36, 32, 30, 36, 24, 36, 25, 35], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [202, 274, 144, 220, 162, 160, 272, 224, 255, 181] to [202, 274, 132, 220, 162, 160, 272, 224, 255, 181].
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [202, 274, 144, 220, 162, 160, 272, 224, 255, 181] to [202, 274, 132, 220, 162, 160, 272, 224, 255, 181]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
