The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=1
 - d=[12]
 - p=[286]
our disinterested advice would be to go second.

The problem solver wants to go second. Ok, I'll take the first move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[286] (keep in mind that d=[12], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [286] to [274].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[274] (keep in mind that d=[12], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [274] to [273].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
