The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[27, 31, 26, 29, 21, 32, 36, 32, 25, 21]
 - p=[216, 102, 198, 184, 136, 190, 239, 185, 154, 145]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[216, 102, 198, 184, 136, 190, 239, 185, 154, 145] (keep in mind that d=[27, 31, 26, 29, 21, 32, 36, 32, 25, 21], to grasp the whole situation).

Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
