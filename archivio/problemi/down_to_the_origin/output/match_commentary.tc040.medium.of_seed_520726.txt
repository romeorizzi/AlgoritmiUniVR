The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[36, 29, 26, 27, 29, 30, 30, 35, 33, 25]
 - p=[204, 198, 112, 165, 159, 110, 168, 257, 252, 278]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[204, 198, 112, 165, 159, 110, 168, 257, 252, 278] (keep in mind that d=[36, 29, 26, 27, 29, 30, 30, 35, 33, 25], to grasp the whole situation).
The winning move [188, 198, 112, 165, 159, 110, 168, 257, 252, 278] is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
[[204, 198, 112, 165, 159, 94, 168, 257, 252, 278]] (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [204, 198, 112, 165, 159, 110, 168, 257, 252, 278] to [204, 198, 112, 165, 159, 94, 168, 257, 252, 278].
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [204, 198, 112, 165, 159, 110, 168, 257, 252, 278] to [204, 198, 112, 165, 159, 94, 168, 257, 252, 278]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
