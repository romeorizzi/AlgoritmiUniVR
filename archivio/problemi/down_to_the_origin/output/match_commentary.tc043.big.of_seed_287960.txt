The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[25482, 44203, 37350, 33878, 24744, 27484, 47701, 36597, 35661, 42967]
 - p=[129356, 100077, 109016, 174868, 160226, 175122, 156112, 160400, 134399, 114112]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:

 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   {next_ps}
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
