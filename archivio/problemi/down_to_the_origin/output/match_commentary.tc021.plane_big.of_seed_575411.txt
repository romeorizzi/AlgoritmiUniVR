The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[49316, 32814]
 - p=[40088, 42082]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[40088, 42082] (keep in mind that d=[49316, 32814], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [40088, 42082] to [9267, 42082].
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [40088, 42082] to [9267, 42082]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[9267, 42082] (keep in mind that d=[49316, 32814], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [9267, 42082] to [0, 42082].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 42082] (keep in mind that d=[49316, 32814], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 42082] to [0, 32815].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 32815] (keep in mind that d=[49316, 32814], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 32815] to [0, 1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 1] (keep in mind that d=[49316, 32814], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 1] to [0, 0].
