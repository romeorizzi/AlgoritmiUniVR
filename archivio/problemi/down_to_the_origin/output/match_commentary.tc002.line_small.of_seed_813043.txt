The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=1
 - d=[4]
 - p=[10]
our disinterested advice would be to go second.

The problem solver wants to go second. Ok, I'll take the first move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[10] (keep in mind that d=[4], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [10] to [6].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[6] (keep in mind that d=[4], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [6] to [5].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[5] (keep in mind that d=[4], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [5] to [1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[1] (keep in mind that d=[4], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [1] to [0].
