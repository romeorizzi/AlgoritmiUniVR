The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[50192, 30124, 50000, 32538, 41732, 45857, 32253, 48215, 47993, 24707]
 - p=[198400, 127087, 152022, 123814, 99256, 128731, 113562, 105827, 173258, 158259]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.
