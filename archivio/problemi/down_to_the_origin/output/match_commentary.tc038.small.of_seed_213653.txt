The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[3, 4, 4, 5, 3, 5, 2, 4, 4, 5]
 - p=[18, 18, 8, 15, 20, 8, 12, 11, 12, 8]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[18, 18, 8, 15, 20, 8, 12, 11, 12, 8] (keep in mind that d=[3, 4, 4, 5, 3, 5, 2, 4, 4, 5], to grasp the whole situation).
