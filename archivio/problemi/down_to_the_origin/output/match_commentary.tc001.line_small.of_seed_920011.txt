The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=1
 - d=[2]
 - p=[18]
our disinterested advice would be to go second.

The problem solver wants to go second. Ok, I'll take the first move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[18] (keep in mind that d=[2], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [18] to [16].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[16] (keep in mind that d=[2], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [16] to [15].
Move 2: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [16] to [15]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[15] (keep in mind that d=[2], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [15] to [13].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[13] (keep in mind that d=[2], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [13] to [12].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[12] (keep in mind that d=[2], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [12] to [10].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[10] (keep in mind that d=[2], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [10] to [9].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[9] (keep in mind that d=[2], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [9] to [7].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[7] (keep in mind that d=[2], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [7] to [6].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[6] (keep in mind that d=[2], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [6] to [4].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[4] (keep in mind that d=[2], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [4] to [3].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[3] (keep in mind that d=[2], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [3] to [1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[1] (keep in mind that d=[2], to grasp the whole situation).
