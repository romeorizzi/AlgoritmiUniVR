The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[4, 4, 6, 2, 3, 3, 6, 3, 4, 2]
 - p=[8, 9, 20, 4, 8, 13, 15, 5, 11, 10]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[8, 9, 20, 4, 8, 13, 15, 5, 11, 10] (keep in mind that d=[4, 4, 6, 2, 3, 3, 6, 3, 4, 2], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:

Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [8, 9, 20, 4, 8, 13, 15, 5, 11, 10] to [8, 9, 20, 4, 8, 13, 15, 5, 11, 9]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
