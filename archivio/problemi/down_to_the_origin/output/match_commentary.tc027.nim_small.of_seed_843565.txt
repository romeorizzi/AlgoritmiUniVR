The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[6, 3, 3, 5, 6, 5, 3, 4, 2, 3]
 - p=[17, 20, 20, 5, 15, 11, 19, 15, 9, 17]
our disinterested advice would be to go second.

The problem solver wants to go second. Ok, I'll take the first move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[17, 20, 20, 5, 15, 11, 19, 15, 9, 17] (keep in mind that d=[6, 3, 3, 5, 6, 5, 3, 4, 2, 3], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [17, 20, 20, 5, 15, 11, 19, 15, 9, 17] to [11, 20, 20, 5, 15, 11, 19, 15, 9, 17].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[11, 20, 20, 5, 15, 11, 19, 15, 9, 17] (keep in mind that d=[6, 3, 3, 5, 6, 5, 3, 4, 2, 3], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   [[11, 20, 20, 5, 15, 8, 19, 15, 9, 17], [10, 20, 20, 5, 15, 11, 19, 15, 9, 17], [11, 20, 20, 2, 15, 11, 19, 15, 9, 17], [11, 20, 20, 5, 13, 11, 19, 15, 9, 17]]
Move 2: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [11, 20, 20, 5, 15, 11, 19, 15, 9, 17] to [11, 20, 20, 5, 15, 8, 19, 15, 9, 17]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
