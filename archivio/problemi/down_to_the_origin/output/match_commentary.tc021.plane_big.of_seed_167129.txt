The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[17816, 19542]
 - p=[42343, 59879]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[42343, 59879] (keep in mind that d=[17816, 19542], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   [[42343, 45795], [36884, 59879]]
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [42343, 59879] to [42343, 45795]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
