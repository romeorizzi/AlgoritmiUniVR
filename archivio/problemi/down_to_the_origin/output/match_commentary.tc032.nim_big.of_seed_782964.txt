The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[27430, 46085, 30697, 21276, 41131, 48170, 50397, 28858, 37044, 25163]
 - p=[105920, 160040, 135289, 91755, 124350, 161528, 128557, 126034, 174904, 96088]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:

The winning move [105920, 157113, 135289, 91755, 124350, 161528, 128557, 126034, 174904, 96088] is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
[[98927, 160040, 135289, 91755, 124350, 161528, 128557, 126034, 174904, 96088]] (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [105920, 160040, 135289, 91755, 124350, 161528, 128557, 126034, 174904, 96088] to [98927, 160040, 135289, 91755, 124350, 161528, 128557, 126034, 174904, 96088].
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [105920, 160040, 135289, 91755, 124350, 161528, 128557, 126034, 174904, 96088] to [98927, 160040, 135289, 91755, 124350, 161528, 128557, 126034, 174904, 96088]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
