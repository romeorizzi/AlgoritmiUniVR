The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=1
 - d=[16]
 - p=[148]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[148] (keep in mind that d=[16], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [148] to [136].
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [148] to [136]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[136] (keep in mind that d=[16], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [136] to [120].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[120] (keep in mind that d=[16], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [120] to [119].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[119] (keep in mind that d=[16], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [119] to [103].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[103] (keep in mind that d=[16], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [103] to [102].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[102] (keep in mind that d=[16], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [102] to [86].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[86] (keep in mind that d=[16], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [86] to [85].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[85] (keep in mind that d=[16], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [85] to [69].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[69] (keep in mind that d=[16], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [69] to [68].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[68] (keep in mind that d=[16], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [68] to [52].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[52] (keep in mind that d=[16], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [52] to [51].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[51] (keep in mind that d=[16], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [51] to [35].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[35] (keep in mind that d=[16], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [35] to [34].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[34] (keep in mind that d=[16], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [34] to [18].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[18] (keep in mind that d=[16], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [18] to [17].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[17] (keep in mind that d=[16], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [17] to [1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[1] (keep in mind that d=[16], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [1] to [0].
