The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[44495, 33725, 33649, 42818, 48175, 29029, 27751, 38976, 32906, 43778]
 - p=[199912, 145051, 192090, 134256, 126014, 133468, 142617, 169207, 159115, 174945]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[199912, 145051, 192090, 134256, 126014, 133468, 142617, 169207, 159115, 174945] (keep in mind that d=[44495, 33725, 33649, 42818, 48175, 29029, 27751, 38976, 32906, 43778], to grasp the whole situation).
The {winning move =} is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
{next_ps} (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [199912, 145051, 192090, 134256, 126014, 133468, 142617, 169207, 159115, 174945] to [199912, 145051, 192090, 134256, 126014, 133468, 142617, 169207, 159115, 155444].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
