The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=1
 - d=[25]
 - p=[169]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[169] (keep in mind that d=[25], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [169] to [156].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[156] (keep in mind that d=[25], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [156] to [131].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[131] (keep in mind that d=[25], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [131] to [130].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[130] (keep in mind that d=[25], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [130] to [105].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[105] (keep in mind that d=[25], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [105] to [104].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[104] (keep in mind that d=[25], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [104] to [79].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[79] (keep in mind that d=[25], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [79] to [78].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[78] (keep in mind that d=[25], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [78] to [53].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[53] (keep in mind that d=[25], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [53] to [52].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[52] (keep in mind that d=[25], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [52] to [27].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[27] (keep in mind that d=[25], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [27] to [26].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[26] (keep in mind that d=[25], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [26] to [1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[1] (keep in mind that d=[25], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [1] to [0].
