The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[3, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 3, 5]
 - p=[20, 20, 6, 5, 18, 19, 18, 9, 12, 6]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[20, 20, 6, 5, 18, 19, 18, 9, 12, 6] (keep in mind that d=[3, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 3, 5], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:

Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [20, 20, 6, 5, 18, 19, 18, 9, 12, 6] to [20, 20, 6, 5, 18, 19, 14, 9, 12, 6]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
