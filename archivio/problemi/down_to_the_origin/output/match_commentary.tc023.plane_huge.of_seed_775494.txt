The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[4390867, 3550044]
 - p=[48400441, 27552351]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# p=[48400441, 27552351] (keep in mind that d=[4390867, 3550044], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   [[46610716, 27552351], [48400441, 24951208]]
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [48400441, 27552351] to [46610716, 27552351]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
