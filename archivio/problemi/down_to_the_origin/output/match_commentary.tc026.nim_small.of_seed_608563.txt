The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[4, 4, 2, 5, 2, 5, 6, 4, 5, 4]
 - p=[16, 15, 14, 11, 9, 17, 5, 19, 6, 4]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[16, 15, 14, 11, 9, 17, 5, 19, 6, 4] (keep in mind that d=[4, 4, 2, 5, 2, 5, 6, 4, 5, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   [[16, 15, 14, 9, 9, 17, 5, 19, 6, 4], [16, 15, 14, 11, 9, 15, 5, 19, 6, 4], [16, 15, 14, 11, 9, 17, 3, 19, 6, 4], [16, 15, 14, 11, 9, 17, 5, 19, 6, 2], [16, 15, 14, 11, 9, 17, 5, 17, 6, 4]]
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [16, 15, 14, 11, 9, 17, 5, 19, 6, 4] to [16, 15, 14, 9, 9, 17, 5, 19, 6, 4]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
