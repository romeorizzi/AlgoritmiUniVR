The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[30, 25, 22, 37, 24, 26, 35, 30, 24, 37]
 - p=[222, 193, 207, 115, 181, 225, 168, 282, 145, 213]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[222, 193, 207, 115, 181, 225, 168, 282, 145, 213] (keep in mind that d=[30, 25, 22, 37, 24, 26, 35, 30, 24, 37], to grasp the whole situation).
The winning move [215, 193, 207, 115, 181, 225, 168, 282, 145, 213] is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
[[222, 193, 207, 115, 181, 225, 168, 275, 145, 213]] (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [222, 193, 207, 115, 181, 225, 168, 282, 145, 213] to [222, 193, 207, 115, 181, 225, 168, 275, 145, 213].
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [222, 193, 207, 115, 181, 225, 168, 282, 145, 213] to [222, 193, 207, 115, 181, 225, 168, 275, 145, 213]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
