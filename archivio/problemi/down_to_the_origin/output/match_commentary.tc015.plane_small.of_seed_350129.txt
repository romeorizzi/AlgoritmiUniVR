The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[6, 2]
 - p=[15, 7]
our disinterested advice would be to go second.

The problem solver wants to go second. Ok, I'll take the first move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[15, 7] (keep in mind that d=[6, 2], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [15, 7] to [9, 7].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[9, 7] (keep in mind that d=[6, 2], to grasp the whole situation).
The {winning move =} is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
{next_ps} (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [9, 7] to [9, 5].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[9, 5] (keep in mind that d=[6, 2], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [9, 5] to [3, 5].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[3, 5] (keep in mind that d=[6, 2], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [3, 5] to [2, 5].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[2, 5] (keep in mind that d=[6, 2], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [2, 5] to [0, 5].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 5] (keep in mind that d=[6, 2], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 5] to [0, 3].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 3] (keep in mind that d=[6, 2], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 3] to [0, 1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 1] (keep in mind that d=[6, 2], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 1] to [0, 0].
