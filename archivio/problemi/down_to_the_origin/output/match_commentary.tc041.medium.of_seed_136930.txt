The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[35, 32, 37, 36, 25, 33, 28, 35, 34, 25]
 - p=[194, 264, 230, 152, 128, 279, 286, 144, 174, 205]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[194, 264, 230, 152, 128, 279, 286, 144, 174, 205] (keep in mind that d=[35, 32, 37, 36, 25, 33, 28, 35, 34, 25], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [194, 264, 230, 152, 128, 279, 286, 144, 174, 205] to [194, 264, 230, 152, 128, 279, 286, 144, 165, 205].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
