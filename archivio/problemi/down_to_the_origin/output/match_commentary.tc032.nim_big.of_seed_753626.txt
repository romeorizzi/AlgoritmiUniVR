The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[28252, 23698, 42026, 25543, 35333, 29406, 41014, 37180, 24523, 37305]
 - p=[135163, 117010, 100652, 187057, 146503, 135980, 116269, 157911, 93386, 130116]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
