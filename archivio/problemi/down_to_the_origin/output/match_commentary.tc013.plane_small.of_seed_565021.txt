The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[3, 6]
 - p=[6, 8]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[6, 8] (keep in mind that d=[3, 6], to grasp the whole situation).
The winning move [5, 8] is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
[[6, 2]] (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [6, 8] to [6, 2].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[6, 2] (keep in mind that d=[3, 6], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [6, 2] to [3, 2].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[3, 2] (keep in mind that d=[3, 6], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [3, 2] to [2, 2].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[2, 2] (keep in mind that d=[3, 6], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [2, 2] to [0, 2].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 2] (keep in mind that d=[3, 6], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 2] to [0, 0].
