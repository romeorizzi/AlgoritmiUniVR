The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[10, 16]
 - p=[54, 97]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[54, 97] (keep in mind that d=[10, 16], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [54, 97] to [54, 95].
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [54, 97] to [54, 95]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[54, 95] (keep in mind that d=[10, 16], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [54, 95] to [44, 95].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[44, 95] (keep in mind that d=[10, 16], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   [[43, 95], [44, 85]]
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[43, 95] (keep in mind that d=[10, 16], to grasp the whole situation).
