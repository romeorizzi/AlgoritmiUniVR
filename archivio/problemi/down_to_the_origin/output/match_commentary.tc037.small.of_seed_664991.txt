The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[5, 2, 2, 3, 3, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2]
 - p=[14, 7, 12, 19, 11, 6, 5, 9, 18, 19]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[14, 7, 12, 19, 11, 6, 5, 9, 18, 19] (keep in mind that d=[5, 2, 2, 3, 3, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   [[14, 7, 12, 19, 11, 0, 5, 9, 18, 19], [10, 7, 12, 19, 11, 6, 5, 9, 18, 19]]
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [14, 7, 12, 19, 11, 6, 5, 9, 18, 19] to [14, 7, 12, 19, 11, 0, 5, 9, 18, 19]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
