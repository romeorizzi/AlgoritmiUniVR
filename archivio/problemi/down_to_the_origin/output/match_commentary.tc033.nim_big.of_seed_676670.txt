The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[42680, 23539, 45663, 49921, 43219, 46056, 37891, 37694, 28391, 22845]
 - p=[195653, 101429, 169157, 134310, 92542, 125343, 92225, 104430, 98388, 176879]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[195653, 101429, 169157, 134310, 92542, 125343, 92225, 104430, 98388, 176879] (keep in mind that d=[42680, 23539, 45663, 49921, 43219, 46056, 37891, 37694, 28391, 22845], to grasp the whole situation).
The {winning move =} is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
{next_ps} (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [195653, 101429, 169157, 134310, 92542, 125343, 92225, 104430, 98388, 176879] to [183413, 101429, 169157, 134310, 92542, 125343, 92225, 104430, 98388, 176879].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
