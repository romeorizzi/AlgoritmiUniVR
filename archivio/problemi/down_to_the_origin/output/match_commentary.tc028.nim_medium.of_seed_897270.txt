The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[22, 26, 23, 15, 20, 20, 14, 19, 20, 15]
 - p=[238, 254, 258, 211, 209, 155, 246, 106, 226, 115]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:

Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
