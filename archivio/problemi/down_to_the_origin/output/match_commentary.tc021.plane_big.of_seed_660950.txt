The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[49213, 28087]
 - p=[84428, 57281]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[84428, 57281] (keep in mind that d=[49213, 28087], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [84428, 57281] to [50319, 57281].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[50319, 57281] (keep in mind that d=[49213, 28087], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [50319, 57281] to [1106, 57281].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[1106, 57281] (keep in mind that d=[49213, 28087], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   {next_ps}
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[1105, 57281] (keep in mind that d=[49213, 28087], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [1105, 57281] to [0, 57281].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 57281] (keep in mind that d=[49213, 28087], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 57281] to [0, 56176].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 56176] (keep in mind that d=[49213, 28087], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 56176] to [0, 28089].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 28089] (keep in mind that d=[49213, 28087], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 28089] to [0, 28088].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 28088] (keep in mind that d=[49213, 28087], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 28088] to [0, 1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 1] (keep in mind that d=[49213, 28087], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 1] to [0, 0].
