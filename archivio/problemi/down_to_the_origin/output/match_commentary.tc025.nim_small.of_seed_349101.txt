The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[4, 4, 5, 4, 5, 3, 4, 5, 4, 6]
 - p=[19, 6, 9, 4, 10, 11, 4, 12, 19, 9]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[19, 6, 9, 4, 10, 11, 4, 12, 19, 9] (keep in mind that d=[4, 4, 5, 4, 5, 3, 4, 5, 4, 6], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   [[19, 6, 9, 3, 10, 11, 4, 12, 19, 9], [19, 6, 9, 4, 10, 11, 4, 12, 18, 9], [19, 6, 9, 4, 9, 11, 4, 12, 19, 9], [19, 6, 4, 4, 10, 11, 4, 12, 19, 9], [19, 6, 9, 4, 10, 11, 4, 12, 19, 5], [19, 6, 9, 4, 10, 11, 3, 12, 19, 9], [18, 6, 9, 4, 10, 11, 4, 12, 19, 9]]
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [19, 6, 9, 4, 10, 11, 4, 12, 19, 9] to [19, 6, 9, 3, 10, 11, 4, 12, 19, 9]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
