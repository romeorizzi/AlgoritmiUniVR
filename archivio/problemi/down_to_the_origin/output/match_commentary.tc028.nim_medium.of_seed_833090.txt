The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[24, 29, 22, 29, 16, 18, 19, 26, 18, 17]
 - p=[207, 229, 257, 284, 213, 235, 275, 234, 247, 149]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:

 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:

Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
