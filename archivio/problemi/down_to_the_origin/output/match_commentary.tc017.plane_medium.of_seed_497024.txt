The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[12, 18]
 - p=[53, 96]
our disinterested advice would be to go second.

The problem solver wants to go second. Ok, I'll take the first move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[53, 96] (keep in mind that d=[12, 18], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [53, 96] to [41, 96].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[41, 96] (keep in mind that d=[12, 18], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   [[40, 96], [41, 78]]
Move 2: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [41, 96] to [40, 96]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[40, 96] (keep in mind that d=[12, 18], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [40, 96] to [28, 96].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[28, 96] (keep in mind that d=[12, 18], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   [[28, 78], [27, 96]]
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[28, 78] (keep in mind that d=[12, 18], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [28, 78] to [16, 78].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[16, 78] (keep in mind that d=[12, 18], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   [[15, 78], [16, 60]]
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[15, 78] (keep in mind that d=[12, 18], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [15, 78] to [3, 78].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[3, 78] (keep in mind that d=[12, 18], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   [[3, 60], [2, 78]]
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[3, 60] (keep in mind that d=[12, 18], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [3, 60] to [0, 60].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 60] (keep in mind that d=[12, 18], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 60] to [0, 57].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 57] (keep in mind that d=[12, 18], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 57] to [0, 39].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 39] (keep in mind that d=[12, 18], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 39] to [0, 38].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 38] (keep in mind that d=[12, 18], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 38] to [0, 20].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 20] (keep in mind that d=[12, 18], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 20] to [0, 19].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 19] (keep in mind that d=[12, 18], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 19] to [0, 1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 1] (keep in mind that d=[12, 18], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 1] to [0, 0].
