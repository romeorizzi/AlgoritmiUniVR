The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[15, 13]
 - p=[69, 73]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[69, 73] (keep in mind that d=[15, 13], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   [[67, 73], [69, 61]]
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [69, 73] to [67, 73]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[67, 73] (keep in mind that d=[15, 13], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [67, 73] to [52, 73].
