The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[17, 15]
 - p=[50, 60]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[50, 60] (keep in mind that d=[17, 15], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   [[48, 60], [50, 46]]
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [50, 60] to [48, 60]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[48, 60] (keep in mind that d=[17, 15], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [48, 60] to [31, 60].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[31, 60] (keep in mind that d=[17, 15], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   [[30, 60], [31, 45]]
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[30, 60] (keep in mind that d=[17, 15], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [30, 60] to [13, 60].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[13, 60] (keep in mind that d=[17, 15], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[13, 45] (keep in mind that d=[17, 15], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [13, 45] to [0, 45].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 45] (keep in mind that d=[17, 15], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 45] to [0, 32].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 32] (keep in mind that d=[17, 15], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 32] to [0, 17].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 17] (keep in mind that d=[17, 15], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 17] to [0, 16].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 16] (keep in mind that d=[17, 15], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 16] to [0, 1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 1] (keep in mind that d=[17, 15], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 1] to [0, 0].
