The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[40135, 29134, 27525, 33296, 50263, 38416, 21391, 27779, 37856, 33361]
 - p=[151561, 130167, 171430, 129782, 98721, 132356, 193960, 134655, 168218, 155432]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:

The problem solver moves from [151561, 130167, 171430, 129782, 98721, 132356, 193960, 134655, 168218, 155432] to [151561, 130167, 171430, 129782, 60531, 132356, 193960, 134655, 168218, 155432].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
