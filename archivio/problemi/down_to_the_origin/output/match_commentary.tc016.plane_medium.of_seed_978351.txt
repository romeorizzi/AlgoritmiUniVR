The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[10, 18]
 - p=[88, 95]
our disinterested advice would be to go second.

The problem solver wants to go second. Ok, I'll take the first move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[88, 95] (keep in mind that d=[10, 18], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [88, 95] to [78, 95].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[78, 95] (keep in mind that d=[10, 18], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   [[77, 95], [78, 77]]
Move 2: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [78, 95] to [77, 95]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# p=[77, 95] (keep in mind that d=[10, 18], to grasp the whole situation).
