The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[18, 18]
 - p=[54, 63]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[54, 63] (keep in mind that d=[18, 18], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   {next_ps}
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[54, 54] (keep in mind that d=[18, 18], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [54, 54] to [36, 54].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[36, 54] (keep in mind that d=[18, 18], to grasp the whole situation).

The problem solver moves from [0, 36] to [0, 19].

# p=[0, 19] (keep in mind that d=[18, 18], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 19] to [0, 1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 1] (keep in mind that d=[18, 18], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 1] to [0, 0].
