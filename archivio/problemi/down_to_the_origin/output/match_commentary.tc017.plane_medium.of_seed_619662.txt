The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[16, 11]
 - p=[56, 55]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[56, 55] (keep in mind that d=[16, 11], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   {next_ps}
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[56, 53] (keep in mind that d=[16, 11], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [56, 53] to [40, 53].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[40, 53] (keep in mind that d=[16, 11], to grasp the whole situation).

The server reluctancty moves from [40, 42] to [24, 42].

The server reluctancty moves from [24, 31] to [8, 31].

The server reluctancty moves from [7, 31] to [0, 31].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 31] (keep in mind that d=[16, 11], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 31] to [0, 24].
# The server is now facing the position:

The server reluctancty moves from [0, 24] to [0, 13].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 13] (keep in mind that d=[16, 11], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 13] to [0, 12].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 12] (keep in mind that d=[16, 11], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 12] to [0, 1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 1] (keep in mind that d=[16, 11], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 1] to [0, 0].
