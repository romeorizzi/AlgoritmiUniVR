The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[31721, 28121, 34415, 43230, 35135, 22015, 30277, 50144, 46994, 29808]
 - p=[94837, 145703, 172549, 184679, 187281, 106733, 195193, 154232, 146174, 151548]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

The winning move [94837, 117769, 172549, 184679, 187281, 106733, 195193, 154232, 146174, 151548] is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
[[94837, 145703, 172549, 184679, 187281, 106733, 195193, 152884, 146174, 151548]] (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [94837, 145703, 172549, 184679, 187281, 106733, 195193, 154232, 146174, 151548] to [94837, 145703, 172549, 184679, 187281, 106733, 195193, 152884, 146174, 151548].
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [94837, 145703, 172549, 184679, 187281, 106733, 195193, 154232, 146174, 151548] to [94837, 145703, 172549, 184679, 187281, 106733, 195193, 152884, 146174, 151548]!!!
