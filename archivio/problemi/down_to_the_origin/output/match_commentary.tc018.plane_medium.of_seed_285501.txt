The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[18, 17]
 - p=[74, 59]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[74, 59] (keep in mind that d=[18, 17], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   {next_ps}
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[74, 53] (keep in mind that d=[18, 17], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [74, 53] to [56, 53].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[56, 53] (keep in mind that d=[18, 17], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [56, 53] to [55, 53].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[55, 53] (keep in mind that d=[18, 17], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [55, 53] to [37, 53].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[37, 53] (keep in mind that d=[18, 17], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [37, 53] to [36, 53].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[36, 53] (keep in mind that d=[18, 17], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [36, 53] to [18, 53].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[18, 53] (keep in mind that d=[18, 17], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [18, 53] to [17, 53].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[17, 53] (keep in mind that d=[18, 17], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [17, 53] to [0, 53].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 53] (keep in mind that d=[18, 17], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 53] to [0, 36].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 36] (keep in mind that d=[18, 17], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 36] to [0, 19].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 19] (keep in mind that d=[18, 17], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 19] to [0, 18].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 18] (keep in mind that d=[18, 17], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 18] to [0, 1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 1] (keep in mind that d=[18, 17], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 1] to [0, 0].
