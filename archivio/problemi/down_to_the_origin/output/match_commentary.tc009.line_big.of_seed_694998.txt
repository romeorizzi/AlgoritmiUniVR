The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=1
 - d=[10561]
 - p=[66506]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[66506] (keep in mind that d=[10561], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [66506] to [63372].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[63372] (keep in mind that d=[10561], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [63372] to [52811].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[52811] (keep in mind that d=[10561], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [52811] to [52810].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[52810] (keep in mind that d=[10561], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [52810] to [42249].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[42249] (keep in mind that d=[10561], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [42249] to [42248].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[42248] (keep in mind that d=[10561], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [42248] to [31687].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[31687] (keep in mind that d=[10561], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [31687] to [31686].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[31686] (keep in mind that d=[10561], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [31686] to [21125].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[21125] (keep in mind that d=[10561], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [21125] to [21124].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[21124] (keep in mind that d=[10561], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [21124] to [10563].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[10563] (keep in mind that d=[10561], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [10563] to [10562].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[10562] (keep in mind that d=[10561], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [10562] to [1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[1] (keep in mind that d=[10561], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [1] to [0].
