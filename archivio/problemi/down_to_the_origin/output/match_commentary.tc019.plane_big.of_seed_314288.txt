The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[28156, 7020]
 - p=[49319, 42598]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[49319, 42598] (keep in mind that d=[28156, 7020], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [49319, 42598] to [28629, 42598].
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [49319, 42598] to [28629, 42598]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[28629, 42598] (keep in mind that d=[28156, 7020], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [28629, 42598] to [473, 42598].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[473, 42598] (keep in mind that d=[28156, 7020], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   [[473, 35578], [472, 42598]]
