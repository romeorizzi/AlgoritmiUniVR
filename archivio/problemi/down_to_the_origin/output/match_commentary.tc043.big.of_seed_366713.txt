The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[49356, 31886, 23126, 27644, 27935, 51012, 49364, 48458, 36216, 44113]
 - p=[125626, 121163, 132359, 177226, 111785, 150867, 135497, 170339, 91706, 173839]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:

 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   {next_ps}
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
