The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[3, 5]
 - p=[16, 6]
our disinterested advice would be to go second.

The problem solver wants to go second. Ok, I'll take the first move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[16, 6] (keep in mind that d=[3, 5], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [16, 6] to [13, 6].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[13, 6] (keep in mind that d=[3, 5], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   [[13, 1], [12, 6]]
Move 2: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [13, 6] to [13, 1]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[13, 1] (keep in mind that d=[3, 5], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [13, 1] to [10, 1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[10, 1] (keep in mind that d=[3, 5], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [10, 1] to [9, 1].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[9, 1] (keep in mind that d=[3, 5], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [9, 1] to [6, 1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[6, 1] (keep in mind that d=[3, 5], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [6, 1] to [5, 1].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[5, 1] (keep in mind that d=[3, 5], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [5, 1] to [2, 1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[2, 1] (keep in mind that d=[3, 5], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [2, 1] to [1, 1].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[1, 1] (keep in mind that d=[3, 5], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [1, 1] to [0, 1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 1] (keep in mind that d=[3, 5], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 1] to [0, 0].
