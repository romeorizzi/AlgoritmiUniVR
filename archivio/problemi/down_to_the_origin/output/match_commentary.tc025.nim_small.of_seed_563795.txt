The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[6, 4, 6, 6, 6, 6, 4, 6, 4, 4]
 - p=[19, 19, 8, 20, 5, 13, 20, 13, 10, 5]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[19, 19, 8, 20, 5, 13, 20, 13, 10, 5] (keep in mind that d=[6, 4, 6, 6, 6, 6, 4, 6, 4, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The winning move [13, 19, 8, 20, 5, 13, 20, 13, 10, 5] is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
[[19, 19, 8, 20, 5, 13, 20, 13, 8, 5]] (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [19, 19, 8, 20, 5, 13, 20, 13, 10, 5] to [19, 19, 8, 20, 5, 13, 20, 13, 8, 5].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
