The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[2, 3]
 - p=[12, 8]
our disinterested advice would be to go second.

The problem solver wants to go second. Ok, I'll take the first move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[12, 8] (keep in mind that d=[2, 3], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [12, 8] to [10, 8].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[10, 8] (keep in mind that d=[2, 3], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   {next_ps}
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[10, 5] (keep in mind that d=[2, 3], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [10, 5] to [8, 5].

The server reluctancty moves from [8, 2] to [6, 2].

The server reluctancty moves from [3, 0] to [1, 0].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[1, 0] (keep in mind that d=[2, 3], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [1, 0] to [0, 0].
