The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[17, 19]
 - p=[67, 67]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[67, 67] (keep in mind that d=[17, 19], to grasp the whole situation).
The {winning move =} is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
{next_ps} (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [67, 67] to [67, 53].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[67, 53] (keep in mind that d=[17, 19], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [67, 53] to [50, 53].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[50, 53] (keep in mind that d=[17, 19], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [50, 53] to [49, 53].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[49, 53] (keep in mind that d=[17, 19], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [49, 53] to [32, 53].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[32, 53] (keep in mind that d=[17, 19], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [32, 53] to [31, 53].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[31, 53] (keep in mind that d=[17, 19], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [31, 53] to [14, 53].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[14, 53] (keep in mind that d=[17, 19], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [14, 53] to [13, 53].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[13, 53] (keep in mind that d=[17, 19], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [13, 53] to [0, 53].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 53] (keep in mind that d=[17, 19], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 53] to [0, 40].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 40] (keep in mind that d=[17, 19], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 40] to [0, 21].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 21] (keep in mind that d=[17, 19], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 21] to [0, 20].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 20] (keep in mind that d=[17, 19], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 20] to [0, 1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 1] (keep in mind that d=[17, 19], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 1] to [0, 0].
