The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[4, 2]
 - p=[12, 6]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[12, 6] (keep in mind that d=[4, 2], to grasp the whole situation).
The winning move [10, 6] is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
[[12, 5]] (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [12, 6] to [12, 5].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[12, 5] (keep in mind that d=[4, 2], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [12, 5] to [8, 5].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[8, 5] (keep in mind that d=[4, 2], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [8, 5] to [7, 5].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[7, 5] (keep in mind that d=[4, 2], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [7, 5] to [3, 5].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[3, 5] (keep in mind that d=[4, 2], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [3, 5] to [2, 5].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[2, 5] (keep in mind that d=[4, 2], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [2, 5] to [0, 5].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 5] (keep in mind that d=[4, 2], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 5] to [0, 3].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 3] (keep in mind that d=[4, 2], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 3] to [0, 1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 1] (keep in mind that d=[4, 2], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 1] to [0, 0].
