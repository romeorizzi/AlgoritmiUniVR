The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[9, 18]
 - p=[69, 73]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[69, 73] (keep in mind that d=[9, 18], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [69, 73] to [69, 66].
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [69, 73] to [69, 66]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[69, 66] (keep in mind that d=[9, 18], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [69, 66] to [60, 66].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[60, 66] (keep in mind that d=[9, 18], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   [[59, 66], [60, 57]]
