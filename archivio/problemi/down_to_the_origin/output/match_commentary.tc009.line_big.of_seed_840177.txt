The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=1
 - d=[10291]
 - p=[51189]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[51189] (keep in mind that d=[10291], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [51189] to [41168].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[41168] (keep in mind that d=[10291], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [41168] to [30877].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[30877] (keep in mind that d=[10291], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [30877] to [30876].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[30876] (keep in mind that d=[10291], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [30876] to [20585].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[20585] (keep in mind that d=[10291], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [20585] to [20584].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[20584] (keep in mind that d=[10291], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [20584] to [10293].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[10293] (keep in mind that d=[10291], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [10293] to [10292].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[10292] (keep in mind that d=[10291], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [10292] to [1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[1] (keep in mind that d=[10291], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [1] to [0].
