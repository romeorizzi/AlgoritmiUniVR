The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[18, 11]
 - p=[60, 97]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[60, 97] (keep in mind that d=[18, 11], to grasp the whole situation).
The winning move [58, 97] is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
[[60, 87]] (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [60, 97] to [60, 87].
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [60, 97] to [60, 87]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[60, 87] (keep in mind that d=[18, 11], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [60, 87] to [42, 87].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[42, 87] (keep in mind that d=[18, 11], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [42, 87] to [42, 76].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[42, 76] (keep in mind that d=[18, 11], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [42, 76] to [24, 76].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 1] (keep in mind that d=[18, 11], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 1] to [0, 0].
