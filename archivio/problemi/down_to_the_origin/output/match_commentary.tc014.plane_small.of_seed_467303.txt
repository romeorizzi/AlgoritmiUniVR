The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[4, 3]
 - p=[20, 4]
our disinterested advice would be to go second.

The problem solver wants to go second. Ok, I'll take the first move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[20, 4] (keep in mind that d=[4, 3], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [20, 4] to [16, 4].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[16, 4] (keep in mind that d=[4, 3], to grasp the whole situation).
The {winning move =} is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
{next_ps} (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [16, 4] to [16, 1].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[16, 1] (keep in mind that d=[4, 3], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [16, 1] to [12, 1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[12, 1] (keep in mind that d=[4, 3], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [12, 1] to [11, 1].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[11, 1] (keep in mind that d=[4, 3], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [11, 1] to [7, 1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[7, 1] (keep in mind that d=[4, 3], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [7, 1] to [6, 1].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[6, 1] (keep in mind that d=[4, 3], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [6, 1] to [2, 1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[2, 1] (keep in mind that d=[4, 3], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [2, 1] to [1, 1].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[1, 1] (keep in mind that d=[4, 3], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [1, 1] to [0, 1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 1] (keep in mind that d=[4, 3], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 1] to [0, 0].
