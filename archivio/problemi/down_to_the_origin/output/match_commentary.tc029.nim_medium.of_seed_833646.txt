The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[17, 23, 28, 24, 26, 22, 18, 27, 17, 18]
 - p=[294, 106, 265, 264, 267, 189, 218, 268, 185, 283]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[294, 106, 265, 264, 267, 189, 218, 268, 185, 283] (keep in mind that d=[17, 23, 28, 24, 26, 22, 18, 27, 17, 18], to grasp the whole situation).
The {winning move =} is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
{next_ps} (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [294, 106, 265, 264, 267, 189, 218, 268, 185, 283] to [294, 106, 265, 264, 267, 189, 218, 268, 185, 273].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
