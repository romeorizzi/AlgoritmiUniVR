The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[3, 5]
 - p=[14, 18]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[14, 18] (keep in mind that d=[3, 5], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   [[12, 18], [14, 14]]
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [14, 18] to [12, 18]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[12, 18] (keep in mind that d=[3, 5], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [12, 18] to [9, 18].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[9, 18] (keep in mind that d=[3, 5], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   [[8, 18], [9, 13]]
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[8, 18] (keep in mind that d=[3, 5], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [8, 18] to [5, 18].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[5, 18] (keep in mind that d=[3, 5], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   [[4, 18], [5, 13]]
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[4, 18] (keep in mind that d=[3, 5], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [4, 18] to [1, 18].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[1, 18] (keep in mind that d=[3, 5], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   [[0, 18], [1, 13]]
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 18] (keep in mind that d=[3, 5], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 18] to [0, 13].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 13] (keep in mind that d=[3, 5], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 13] to [0, 12].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 12] (keep in mind that d=[3, 5], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 12] to [0, 7].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 7] (keep in mind that d=[3, 5], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 7] to [0, 6].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 6] (keep in mind that d=[3, 5], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 6] to [0, 1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 1] (keep in mind that d=[3, 5], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 1] to [0, 0].
