The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[26150, 48478, 37115, 47000, 48524, 35494, 31713, 26369, 31618, 33167]
 - p=[125549, 178047, 159558, 172470, 186428, 180950, 146368, 123159, 132611, 182564]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[125549, 178047, 159558, 172470, 186428, 180950, 146368, 123159, 132611, 182564] (keep in mind that d=[26150, 48478, 37115, 47000, 48524, 35494, 31713, 26369, 31618, 33167], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [125549, 178047, 159558, 172470, 186428, 180950, 146368, 123159, 132611, 182564] to [125549, 178047, 159558, 172470, 157104, 180950, 146368, 123159, 132611, 182564].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
