The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[27880, 38786]
 - p=[17281, 66383]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[17281, 66383] (keep in mind that d=[27880, 38786], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [17281, 66383] to [17281, 56068].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[17281, 56068] (keep in mind that d=[27880, 38786], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [17281, 56068] to [0, 56068].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 56068] (keep in mind that d=[27880, 38786], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 56068] to [0, 38787].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 38787] (keep in mind that d=[27880, 38786], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 38787] to [0, 1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 1] (keep in mind that d=[27880, 38786], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 1] to [0, 0].
