The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[44854, 46837, 31190, 22843, 30719, 28791, 49178, 21500, 36735, 36296]
 - p=[115864, 105574, 136232, 107304, 98828, 108613, 126584, 158297, 187345, 92218]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:

 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   {next_ps}
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
