The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[12016, 27004]
 - p=[67700, 58246]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[67700, 58246] (keep in mind that d=[12016, 27004], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   [[64321, 58246], [67700, 34620]]
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [67700, 58246] to [64321, 58246]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
