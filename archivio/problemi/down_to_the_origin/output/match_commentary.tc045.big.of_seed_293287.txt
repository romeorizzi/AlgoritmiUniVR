The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[32564, 37465, 38187, 48693, 45013, 47566, 26542, 23390, 39400, 34236]
 - p=[105923, 120837, 114502, 198824, 187079, 171918, 102576, 156074, 148902, 164027]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[105923, 120837, 114502, 198824, 187079, 171918, 102576, 156074, 148902, 164027] (keep in mind that d=[32564, 37465, 38187, 48693, 45013, 47566, 26542, 23390, 39400, 34236], to grasp the whole situation).
The {winning move =} is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
{next_ps} (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [105923, 120837, 114502, 198824, 187079, 171918, 102576, 156074, 148902, 164027] to [105923, 120837, 83722, 198824, 187079, 171918, 102576, 156074, 148902, 164027].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
