The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[2, 3, 2, 5, 5, 3, 6, 5, 2, 5]
 - p=[6, 6, 20, 7, 20, 6, 6, 6, 5, 16]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[6, 6, 20, 7, 20, 6, 6, 6, 5, 16] (keep in mind that d=[2, 3, 2, 5, 5, 3, 6, 5, 2, 5], to grasp the whole situation).
The winning move [4, 6, 20, 7, 20, 6, 6, 6, 5, 16] is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
[[6, 6, 20, 6, 20, 6, 6, 6, 5, 16]] (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [6, 6, 20, 7, 20, 6, 6, 6, 5, 16] to [6, 6, 20, 6, 20, 6, 6, 6, 5, 16].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
