The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[3154526, 3300306]
 - p=[97044510, 47592160]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[97044510, 47592160] (keep in mind that d=[3154526, 3300306], to grasp the whole situation).
The winning move [96023672, 47592160] is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
[[97044510, 45312691]] (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [97044510, 47592160] to [97044510, 45312691].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
