The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[46591, 29403, 36202, 39228, 40024, 40873, 43296, 29837, 35639, 30539]
 - p=[150096, 146807, 169254, 158992, 94230, 98193, 136920, 162072, 104731, 123885]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[150096, 146807, 169254, 158992, 94230, 98193, 136920, 162072, 104731, 123885] (keep in mind that d=[46591, 29403, 36202, 39228, 40024, 40873, 43296, 29837, 35639, 30539], to grasp the whole situation).
The {winning move =} is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
{next_ps} (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [150096, 146807, 169254, 158992, 94230, 98193, 136920, 162072, 104731, 123885] to [150096, 146807, 143460, 158992, 94230, 98193, 136920, 162072, 104731, 123885].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
