The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[16, 11]
 - p=[69, 71]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[69, 71] (keep in mind that d=[16, 11], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   {next_ps}
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[62, 71] (keep in mind that d=[16, 11], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [62, 71] to [46, 71].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[46, 71] (keep in mind that d=[16, 11], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [46, 71] to [45, 71].

# p=[45, 71] (keep in mind that d=[16, 11], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [45, 71] to [29, 71].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:

The problem solver moves from [29, 71] to [28, 71].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[28, 71] (keep in mind that d=[16, 11], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [28, 71] to [12, 71].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[12, 71] (keep in mind that d=[16, 11], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [12, 71] to [11, 71].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[11, 71] (keep in mind that d=[16, 11], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [11, 71] to [0, 71].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 71] (keep in mind that d=[16, 11], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 71] to [0, 60].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 60] (keep in mind that d=[16, 11], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 60] to [0, 49].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 49] (keep in mind that d=[16, 11], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 49] to [0, 48].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 48] (keep in mind that d=[16, 11], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 48] to [0, 37].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 37] (keep in mind that d=[16, 11], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 37] to [0, 36].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 36] (keep in mind that d=[16, 11], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 36] to [0, 25].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:

The problem solver moves from [0, 25] to [0, 24].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 24] (keep in mind that d=[16, 11], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 24] to [0, 13].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 13] (keep in mind that d=[16, 11], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 13] to [0, 12].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 12] (keep in mind that d=[16, 11], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 12] to [0, 1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 1] (keep in mind that d=[16, 11], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 1] to [0, 0].
