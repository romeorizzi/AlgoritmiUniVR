The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=1
 - d=[23]
 - p=[178]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[178] (keep in mind that d=[23], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [178] to [168].
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [178] to [168]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[168] (keep in mind that d=[23], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [168] to [145].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[145] (keep in mind that d=[23], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [145] to [144].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[144] (keep in mind that d=[23], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [144] to [121].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[121] (keep in mind that d=[23], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [121] to [120].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[120] (keep in mind that d=[23], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [120] to [97].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[97] (keep in mind that d=[23], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [97] to [96].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[96] (keep in mind that d=[23], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [96] to [73].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[73] (keep in mind that d=[23], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [73] to [72].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[72] (keep in mind that d=[23], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [72] to [49].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[49] (keep in mind that d=[23], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [49] to [48].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[48] (keep in mind that d=[23], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [48] to [25].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[25] (keep in mind that d=[23], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [25] to [24].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[24] (keep in mind that d=[23], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [24] to [1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[1] (keep in mind that d=[23], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [1] to [0].
