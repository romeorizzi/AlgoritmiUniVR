The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=1
 - d=[29]
 - p=[279]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[279] (keep in mind that d=[29], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [279] to [270].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[270] (keep in mind that d=[29], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [270] to [241].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[241] (keep in mind that d=[29], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [241] to [240].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[240] (keep in mind that d=[29], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [240] to [211].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[211] (keep in mind that d=[29], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [211] to [210].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[210] (keep in mind that d=[29], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [210] to [181].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[181] (keep in mind that d=[29], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [181] to [180].

The server reluctancty moves from [60] to [31].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[31] (keep in mind that d=[29], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [31] to [30].
# The server is now facing the position:
