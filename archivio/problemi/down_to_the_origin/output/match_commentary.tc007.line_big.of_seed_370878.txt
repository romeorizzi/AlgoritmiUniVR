The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=1
 - d=[10423]
 - p=[61912]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[61912] (keep in mind that d=[10423], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [61912] to [52120].
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [61912] to [52120]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[52120] (keep in mind that d=[10423], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [52120] to [41697].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[41697] (keep in mind that d=[10423], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [41697] to [41696].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[41696] (keep in mind that d=[10423], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [41696] to [31273].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[31273] (keep in mind that d=[10423], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [31273] to [31272].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[31272] (keep in mind that d=[10423], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [31272] to [20849].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[20849] (keep in mind that d=[10423], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [20849] to [20848].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[20848] (keep in mind that d=[10423], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [20848] to [10425].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[10425] (keep in mind that d=[10423], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [10425] to [10424].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[10424] (keep in mind that d=[10423], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [10424] to [1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[1] (keep in mind that d=[10423], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [1] to [0].
