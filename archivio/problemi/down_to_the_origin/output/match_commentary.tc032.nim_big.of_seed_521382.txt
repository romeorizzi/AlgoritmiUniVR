The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[41973, 40923, 50399, 23307, 48443, 22639, 35322, 36358, 48859, 38296]
 - p=[186235, 126278, 114425, 155954, 182300, 126583, 134047, 182136, 122980, 104390]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:

 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   {next_ps}
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
