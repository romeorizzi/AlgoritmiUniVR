The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[3, 3]
 - p=[19, 20]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[19, 20] (keep in mind that d=[3, 3], to grasp the whole situation).
The winning move [16, 20] is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
[[19, 19]] (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [19, 20] to [19, 19].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[19, 19] (keep in mind that d=[3, 3], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [19, 19] to [16, 19].

The server reluctancty moves from [0, 12] to [0, 9].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 9] (keep in mind that d=[3, 3], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 9] to [0, 8].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 8] (keep in mind that d=[3, 3], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 8] to [0, 5].
