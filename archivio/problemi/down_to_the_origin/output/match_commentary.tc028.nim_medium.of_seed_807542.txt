The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[23, 14, 19, 26, 25, 24, 16, 27, 28, 26]
 - p=[296, 185, 164, 190, 201, 205, 109, 258, 259, 133]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[296, 185, 164, 190, 201, 205, 109, 258, 259, 133] (keep in mind that d=[23, 14, 19, 26, 25, 24, 16, 27, 28, 26], to grasp the whole situation).
The winning move [285, 185, 164, 190, 201, 205, 109, 258, 259, 133] is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
[[296, 185, 164, 190, 196, 205, 109, 258, 259, 133]] (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [296, 185, 164, 190, 201, 205, 109, 258, 259, 133] to [296, 185, 164, 190, 196, 205, 109, 258, 259, 133].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
