The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=1
 - d=[21]
 - p=[103]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[103] (keep in mind that d=[21], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [103] to [88].
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [103] to [88]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[88] (keep in mind that d=[21], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [88] to [67].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[67] (keep in mind that d=[21], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [67] to [66].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[66] (keep in mind that d=[21], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [66] to [45].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[45] (keep in mind that d=[21], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [45] to [44].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[44] (keep in mind that d=[21], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [44] to [23].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[23] (keep in mind that d=[21], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [23] to [22].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[22] (keep in mind that d=[21], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [22] to [1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[1] (keep in mind that d=[21], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [1] to [0].
