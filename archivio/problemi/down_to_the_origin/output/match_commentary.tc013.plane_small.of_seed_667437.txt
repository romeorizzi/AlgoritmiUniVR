The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[3, 3]
 - p=[16, 6]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[16, 6] (keep in mind that d=[3, 3], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   {next_ps}
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[14, 6] (keep in mind that d=[3, 3], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [14, 6] to [11, 6].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[11, 6] (keep in mind that d=[3, 3], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   {next_ps}
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[11, 3] (keep in mind that d=[3, 3], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [11, 3] to [8, 3].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[8, 3] (keep in mind that d=[3, 3], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   {next_ps}
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[8, 0] (keep in mind that d=[3, 3], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [8, 0] to [5, 0].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[5, 0] (keep in mind that d=[3, 3], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [5, 0] to [4, 0].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[4, 0] (keep in mind that d=[3, 3], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [4, 0] to [1, 0].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[1, 0] (keep in mind that d=[3, 3], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [1, 0] to [0, 0].
