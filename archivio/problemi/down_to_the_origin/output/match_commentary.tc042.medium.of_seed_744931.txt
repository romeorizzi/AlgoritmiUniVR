The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[35, 26, 32, 29, 21, 31, 29, 24, 34, 25]
 - p=[108, 217, 284, 241, 275, 187, 278, 172, 136, 286]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[108, 217, 284, 241, 275, 187, 278, 172, 136, 286] (keep in mind that d=[35, 26, 32, 29, 21, 31, 29, 24, 34, 25], to grasp the whole situation).
The {winning move =} is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
{next_ps} (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [108, 217, 284, 241, 275, 187, 278, 172, 136, 286] to [108, 217, 284, 241, 275, 158, 278, 172, 136, 286].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
