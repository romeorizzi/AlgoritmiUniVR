The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[36274, 48338, 34914, 37587, 27385, 37323, 22573, 42110, 41345, 40433]
 - p=[186861, 101575, 136781, 111219, 135601, 119638, 150106, 144522, 148306, 174647]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:

 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   {next_ps}
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
