The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[2, 4]
 - p=[19, 7]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[19, 7] (keep in mind that d=[2, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   [[17, 7], [19, 6]]
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [19, 7] to [17, 7]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[17, 7] (keep in mind that d=[2, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [17, 7] to [15, 7].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[15, 7] (keep in mind that d=[2, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
