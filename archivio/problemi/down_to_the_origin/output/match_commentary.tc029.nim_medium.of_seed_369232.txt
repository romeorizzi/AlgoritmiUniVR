The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[23, 20, 24, 17, 16, 14, 26, 25, 25, 22]
 - p=[212, 167, 296, 184, 180, 217, 138, 139, 132, 271]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[212, 167, 296, 184, 180, 217, 138, 139, 132, 271] (keep in mind that d=[23, 20, 24, 17, 16, 14, 26, 25, 25, 22], to grasp the whole situation).
The winning move [210, 167, 296, 184, 180, 217, 138, 139, 132, 271] is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
[[212, 167, 296, 184, 180, 211, 138, 139, 132, 271]] (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [212, 167, 296, 184, 180, 217, 138, 139, 132, 271] to [212, 167, 296, 184, 180, 211, 138, 139, 132, 271].
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [212, 167, 296, 184, 180, 217, 138, 139, 132, 271] to [212, 167, 296, 184, 180, 211, 138, 139, 132, 271]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
