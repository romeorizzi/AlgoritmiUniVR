The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[5, 4]
 - p=[19, 20]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[19, 20] (keep in mind that d=[5, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The {winning move =} is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
{next_ps} (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [19, 20] to [19, 16].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[19, 16] (keep in mind that d=[5, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [19, 16] to [14, 16].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[14, 16] (keep in mind that d=[5, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [14, 16] to [13, 16].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[13, 16] (keep in mind that d=[5, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [13, 16] to [8, 16].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[8, 16] (keep in mind that d=[5, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [8, 16] to [7, 16].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[7, 16] (keep in mind that d=[5, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [7, 16] to [2, 16].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[2, 16] (keep in mind that d=[5, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [2, 16] to [1, 16].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[1, 16] (keep in mind that d=[5, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [1, 16] to [0, 16].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 16] (keep in mind that d=[5, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 16] to [0, 15].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 15] (keep in mind that d=[5, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 15] to [0, 11].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 11] (keep in mind that d=[5, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 11] to [0, 10].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 10] (keep in mind that d=[5, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 10] to [0, 6].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 6] (keep in mind that d=[5, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 6] to [0, 5].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 5] (keep in mind that d=[5, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 5] to [0, 1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 1] (keep in mind that d=[5, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 1] to [0, 0].
