The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[4, 3, 6, 6, 3, 4, 4, 6, 6, 5]
 - p=[19, 8, 14, 4, 8, 16, 11, 20, 7, 13]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[19, 8, 14, 4, 8, 16, 11, 20, 7, 13] (keep in mind that d=[4, 3, 6, 6, 3, 4, 4, 6, 6, 5], to grasp the whole situation).

Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [19, 8, 14, 4, 8, 16, 11, 20, 7, 13] to [19, 8, 14, 4, 8, 16, 11, 15, 7, 13]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
