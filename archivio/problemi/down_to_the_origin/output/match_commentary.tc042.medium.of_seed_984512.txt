The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[33, 24, 35, 31, 35, 26, 33, 37, 34, 36]
 - p=[178, 183, 274, 213, 151, 238, 137, 145, 261, 131]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[178, 183, 274, 213, 151, 238, 137, 145, 261, 131] (keep in mind that d=[33, 24, 35, 31, 35, 26, 33, 37, 34, 36], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   {next_ps}
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
