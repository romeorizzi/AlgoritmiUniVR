The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=2
 - d=[17, 11]
 - p=[70, 85]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[70, 85] (keep in mind that d=[17, 11], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [70, 85] to [55, 85].
Move {time}: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form {p} to {next_ps[0]}!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.

# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[55, 85] (keep in mind that d=[17, 11], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [55, 85] to [38, 85].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[38, 85] (keep in mind that d=[17, 11], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   {next_ps}
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[38, 74] (keep in mind that d=[17, 11], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [38, 74] to [21, 74].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[21, 74] (keep in mind that d=[17, 11], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   {next_ps}
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[20, 74] (keep in mind that d=[17, 11], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [20, 74] to [3, 74].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[3, 74] (keep in mind that d=[17, 11], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   {next_ps}
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[3, 63] (keep in mind that d=[17, 11], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [3, 63] to [0, 63].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 63] (keep in mind that d=[17, 11], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 63] to [0, 60].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 60] (keep in mind that d=[17, 11], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 60] to [0, 49].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 49] (keep in mind that d=[17, 11], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 49] to [0, 48].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 48] (keep in mind that d=[17, 11], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 48] to [0, 37].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 37] (keep in mind that d=[17, 11], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 37] to [0, 36].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 36] (keep in mind that d=[17, 11], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 36] to [0, 25].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 25] (keep in mind that d=[17, 11], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 25] to [0, 24].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 24] (keep in mind that d=[17, 11], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 24] to [0, 13].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 13] (keep in mind that d=[17, 11], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 13] to [0, 12].
# The server is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 12] (keep in mind that d=[17, 11], to grasp the whole situation).
The server reluctancty moves from [0, 12] to [0, 1].
# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[0, 1] (keep in mind that d=[17, 11], to grasp the whole situation).
The problem solver moves from [0, 1] to [0, 0].
