The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[5, 5, 5, 4, 4, 4, 3, 5, 6, 6]
 - p=[15, 16, 18, 5, 6, 8, 9, 6, 5, 11]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[15, 16, 18, 5, 6, 8, 9, 6, 5, 11] (keep in mind that d=[5, 5, 5, 4, 4, 4, 3, 5, 6, 6], to grasp the whole situation).
The winning move [15, 13, 18, 5, 6, 8, 9, 6, 5, 11] is missing from your list of all the winning moves:
[[15, 16, 18, 5, 6, 8, 9, 5, 5, 11]] (I will not check and report on the alternative winning moves for the rest of this one match.)
The problem solver moves from [15, 16, 18, 5, 6, 8, 9, 6, 5, 11] to [15, 16, 18, 5, 6, 8, 9, 5, 5, 11].
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [15, 16, 18, 5, 6, 8, 9, 6, 5, 11] to [15, 16, 18, 5, 6, 8, 9, 5, 5, 11]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
