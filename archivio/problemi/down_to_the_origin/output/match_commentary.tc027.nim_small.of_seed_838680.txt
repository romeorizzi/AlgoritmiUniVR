The server has proposed to play the game:
 - n=10
 - d=[5, 2, 3, 3, 3, 6, 3, 6, 5, 4]
 - p=[5, 12, 9, 5, 15, 7, 18, 11, 13, 5]
our disinterested advice would be to go first.

The problem solver wants to go first. Ok, the server will be second to move.

Good choice! The problem solver is ahead.

# The problem solver is now facing the position:
# p=[5, 12, 9, 5, 15, 7, 18, 11, 13, 5] (keep in mind that d=[5, 2, 3, 3, 3, 6, 3, 6, 5, 4], to grasp the whole situation).
 He actually shows off with a wider range of candidates for his winning moves:
   [[5, 12, 9, 5, 14, 7, 18, 11, 13, 5], [5, 12, 9, 5, 15, 7, 15, 11, 13, 5], [5, 12, 9, 5, 15, 1, 18, 11, 13, 5], [5, 12, 9, 5, 15, 7, 18, 11, 12, 5], [4, 12, 9, 5, 15, 7, 18, 11, 13, 5], [5, 10, 9, 5, 15, 7, 18, 11, 13, 5], [5, 12, 8, 5, 15, 7, 18, 11, 13, 5], [5, 12, 9, 5, 15, 7, 18, 11, 13, 1], [5, 12, 9, 5, 15, 7, 18, 5, 13, 5], [5, 12, 9, 4, 15, 7, 18, 11, 13, 5]]
Move 1: it appears that the problem solver has made a serious mistake here with his move form [5, 12, 9, 5, 15, 7, 18, 11, 13, 5] to [5, 12, 9, 5, 14, 7, 18, 11, 13, 5]!!! The server is now ahead and on the go to win this match.
